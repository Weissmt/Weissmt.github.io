		My name is Peyton. About 4 years ago my parents were traveling across the ocean on a boat called the Northwind. They were on there way to France, but they never made it. Everyone told me the boat must have sunk, everyone told me they were dead. I believed them, but I always kept hope that they were still alive.

At one point in my life everything was perfect, but then the terrible news came. Two days after my parents were supposed to be in France, their ship had sunk. Rescuers searched and searched for the boat, but they never found it. Finally, the government made the conclusion that the boat must have been caught in a storm and sank. 

Ever since my parents passed away, my Grandma has been living with me in my house in Castle Heights. We live in the same house I grew up in with my parents, and it always seemed like an ordinary house. I go to the same school, and have all the same friends. Our house is beautiful, it looks right over a cliff, it has a garden, and even a pool!

	Then one day, I found a letter. The day was just like any other day. I woke up, got ready, ate breakfast, then went outside to water the flowers. When I got to the garden I found a letter on the ground. At first I was hesitant to pick it up, then after looking at it like it was an alien; I picked it up and read it. 



It read,
“Our Dear Petyon,
  We need your help, we’re stuck on a magical island out in the middle of    
            the sea. The garden you are standing in is a portal to this mysterious land. 
            If you look in the envelope there should be some sort of object, maybe a 
            bracelet or a crown.  Whatever it is put it on and say, “ Leppell.” We don&#39;t 
            want to put you in any harm, but you’re our only hope. I know your 
            probably confused, but please do what the letter says.
		Help us come back home,
Mother &amp; Father”

I read it over and over to make sure what I read was correct. Cautiously, I looked in the envelope to see a necklace with a key on it. This was it, this was the object they told me to put on. I glanced back at the house. What would grandmother do if she found out? Forcing those thoughts to the back of my head, I put the necklace around my neck and shouted, “ Leppell!” Suddenly, the ground started shaking, the petals started to fall from their stems and spin around me, it became extremely windy. All of the commotion became overwhelming. Before I knew it, everything was black. 

	My eyes didn&#39;t want open, they didn’t want to open at all. Whatever just happened in my garden was crazy and weird! I was just fine with laying here for as long as I wanted. That feeling ended quickly when I felt water lightly touching me. I opened my eyes and looked around. At first I was very confused. Then I realized I was on some sort of island. 

	Dusting the sand off of me, I stood up. There really wasn’t anything on the island. Just some big rocks, trees, and sand. I spent some time looking around. My stomach rumbled and I knew I needed to find some food. There were some coconuts that had fallen from a tree. I found a rock and cracked the coconut open. The coconut milk was refreshing, it seemed to cool me down. I looked around for more food and that’s when I saw a mysterious waterfall. Curious, I walked through it. Now I’ve had some pretty amazing moments in my life; but nothing could have topped what I saw right in front of me. There were my parents, sitting in something that looked like a fort. 

	I ran to them with joy. I couldn’t believe it, they weren&#39;t dead! They were alive this whole time. They told me what happened. They said there was a storm, and they ended up on this island. When they were here they found out that they could send one message to one place in the entire world. Of course if they sent a random letter to the government, there was very little hope that the government was going to believe them. So they sent it to the garden, knowing I was going to get it.

 Thinking I was going to get something that would help them, they wrote me a letter hoping I would follow their instructions. “ So what do we do now?” I asked. 
“Well… how did you get here?” my father asked.
“I just found a necklace with a key on it and put it on, then all of a sudden everything went black.” I replied.
“Oh, we should’ve known!” my mother shouted. “This whole time we’ve been looking around for something that would let us leave, we discovered a box that had a lock on it. We thought it must have had something to do with freeing us because something inside of it was glowing.” my mother said pacing inside the little fort.
	“Well do you still have it?” I questioned. 
	“ Yes!” she cried. “ Right over here. I kept it just in case.”
I stared at it closely; it was glowing and something blue was inside. I took the necklace off, put the key in the lock, and stood back. 

All of a sudden the box flew open. A bright blue crystal sprang into the air. 
“Quick, grab it!” my mother yelled.
I ran over to the box and reached for the crystal. It was like staring into the sun, it was so bright it could blind someone. “I have it!” I cried. “What do I do now?” Right after I said that, it started happening again.

 This time instead of flowers, sand was swirling around us. Again I thought I was stuck in a huge tornado. I looked over at my parents, the same thing was happening to them. It felt like I was having a panic attack. I looked around one more time; then everything went black.

Memories started roaming through my head. It was like I was back at the island. All of a sudden the crystal wasn&#39;t working, the sand wasn’t spinning. There was some sort of hurricane. My mother was yelling my name over and over. A huge wave swept over her. “ No!” I yelled.

I opened my eyes and I was panting. I was in my garden. 
	“Peyton” my mother whispered. 
	She and my father were hovering over me. “The hurricane swept you away!” I shouted looking over at my mother.
	“ No, No No … after you grabbed the crystal we all blacked out, but you didn’t come back so easily, it was just a bad dream. Everything is ok.” my mother reassured me. I took a breath of relief. “Now let&#39;s go find your Grandmother!” my mother said.
	
We walked into the house. Apparently, time goes by a lot slower at home because my grandmother thought I was still in the garden. When she saw my parents she looked like a human finding a unicorn in the forest. They all hugged, cried, and hugged and cried some more. We explained everything that happened. Finally, we reported to everyone that they were found, and our family’s story spread throughout the nation. 

Over the past few years I&#39;ve learned so much. After my parents died, I sulked for a long time. Eventually, I embraced what happened and learned to move. Mostly, I learned to never give up hope. I’m grateful that I found my parents and can’t wait for the adventure’s ahead.

	The sun was about to set and Alinna and Jade and their younger brother Alex were talking in their tent. 
“Have you ever heard of the Legend of the Everfree?” asked Jade. 
“No, what is that?” asked Alinna. 
“The Legend is a forest monster. I heard that It lives in the woods and comes out at night. Then at night, if the Everfree finds you it will take you back to it’s cave and never let you leave because it likes to collect people. The Everfree also leaves behind a trail of gold sparkles, which people like to try and find.” said Jade . 
“ We should go and look for this thing but we must not tell mom and dad because they will stop us” said Jade. 
“Are you guys sure?” said Alinna. 
 “Yes” said Alex
 “This seems really scary and what if the everfree is true then we will be trapped forever?” said Alinna. They all agreed to go. 
Jade and Alinna go looking for the everfree with their brother Alex, because they wanted to see if the stories were true about the gold sparkles. They go to find the Everfree and don’t come back when morning rises. Their parents start to worry and while the kids are trying to find their way out of the Everfree traps and obstacles the two parents go looking for their three kids. One trap is wolves that are guarding the cave.They ran past the wolves  who then chase them all through the woods . 
”We are going to die!” said Alex with fear in his voice.
 “If we die I love you.” Alinna said to Jade. 
 “I love you too.” Jade said .
Running from the wolves was the scariest night of their lives by far. While running from the wolves they spotted a rope bridge that they maybe could cross. Then they could untie the bridge so the wolves could not chase them any more. As the three kids ran to the bridge they told Alex to get in front of them.
As Alinna was about to cross the bridge the bridge broke and she was going to fall but Jade screamed 
“Jump!” So she took a leap of faith and jumped to the other side of the mountain. They all got to the other side safely and are so lucky Alinna made that jump.
When they get to the campsite their parents were gone so they go looking for their parents.  After hours of looking they don&#39;t find them In the deep dark woods. 
While they were looking for their parents they spot two or more Everfrees in the woods and one of them has their dad. They ran to their dad and he said that their mom was with the creature and they had to go get her. Going back to that cave would be very dangerous but they had to go back to get their mother. 
“Let’s make a plan.” said Dad. 
“I will grab a big log and use that as my bridge and I will cross and I will go to the cave and distract the everfree and while im doing that you three will cross and grab mom” said dad. Their plan worked and about an hour later they were all going back to the campsite. The lesson that the three kids learned was not to go looking for a weird creature in the woods even if there might be gold sparkles.

One day John was flying over the amazon rainforest with his hunting partner Derek who he had met just before the trip and his pilot and friend Adam. When Derek and John got out of the helicopter adam flew away and they started to hunt. Everything was going smoothly, they got a lot of food and then went do the landing area where they would meet adam. The helicopter never came.

As it started to get dark they built a shelter and ate some food and drank water. The next morning the helicopter still hadn&#39;t come. A few more days passed and there was still no sign of a helicopter anywhere. There was also no food both the men were starving the tried to eat plants but they never got any energy from it.

Soon they were getting desperate and would go everywhere for food. Finally after almost two and a half weeks later John went down to the river and there were fish everywhere , he brought back as much as he could carry. As John gets back he sees Derek with a mushroom in his hands immediately Derek charges him and John runs out of the way dropping all the fish Derek eats all the fish then looks over at John then John gets his gun and Derek backs off. For a day Derek was a cannibal trying to eat John but after Derek finished digesting the mushroom he returned to normal. 
 
Then  one day John and Derek decide to go and try to Signal a helicopter or a plane to save them but as they were walking and they found a helicopter that looked just like the one that they took as they walked closer they found that it was their helicopter. It had run out of fuel and  couldn&#39;t perform an autorotation  which is a helicopter using the wind to keep the blades spinning and land. They also found  Adam&#39;s Body it was pale and leathery and they buried him beside the helicopter. But they also found other survival supplies like food, water and a tent  they also found radio supplies that would help them contact another helicopter or plane.

 After returning to camp they decided to try and Signal somebody after about an hour of nothing but static they finally heard somebody on the other side of the radio  as soon as they heard that they told the person their coordinates and they said they&#39;d be on their way.  In in the end they were rescued John had a broken leg and Derek had PTSD but they were both alive. They&#39;re both going to live full lives and go on more hunting trips together always returning to the same camp to spend the night.

It was a  bright summer afternoon and the Robinsis were going to take a roadtrip to the beach to give the two sisters, Emma and Violet a break from their parents divorce.
“Mom!” I yelled “Where is the bottom of my swimsuit”?!
“It&#39;s in the washer, go look for it.”mom yelled back 
“Kay’’
“Can you go get Emma from her nap and get her changed and ready for the road.’’ When Violet got Emma got ready she looked in the mirror she was an average 13 year old. Long brown hair,big brown eyes. She also loved to do the same things that her friends did, like going to the mall and have sleepovers with her besties. But she also had a lot of her own hobbies like swimming,going to the beach and she just loves wild life.
As they got in the car mom asked,
“Did you get everything’’? 
“ yes I think so, I got the clothes,food, oh I think I forgot Emma at home’’!!
“ WHAT”! Yelled mom.
“ I&#39;m sorry I was just joking!’’ 
“ Don&#39;t do that ever again’’ “or you will get in trouble’’
“Sorry mom I didn&#39;t mean to scare you”.
As the hours passed they Viot looked out the window and sighed,
“ Mom how much more time until we get to the beach”? 
“ About an hour”.
“Ugggg why can&#39;t this car go faster”??
And just like that their mom took a turn and the car rolled and stopped. Emma was screaming and so was their mom. Violet got out of the car and ran to get Emma she was screaming her head off, she had a little scratch on her forehead. Viot was scared to death 
	‘’MOM,MOM where are you’’!!!! Said Violet crying. She was trying to calm Emma down then Viot got up and started looking around to see if she recognized anything, but to her disappointment she knew nothing. They were in the middle of nowhere and there wasn&#39;t any cars driving either. 
“Oh no” “ what am I supposed to do now”? 
Viot walked to the driver&#39;s seat and her mom wasn&#39;t there and she picked up her moms phone and she tried to turn it on to call 911 but it did not work.
	“no ,no,no’’ Viot said clearly trying not to panic.
So she got Emma&#39;s stoller out of the car and put her in it. Then she tried to get out all the clothes and food that she could carry. Violet started to walk toward the beach, and on the side was a forest. Violet looked around.The place was deserted.
	“Why can&#39;t there be people here, come on it&#39;s a beach there is supposed to be people here.’’ Violet said with a mixture of worry,sadness,and frustration.
Violet walked to the forest and started to build a fire. She went to a lot of survival camps and knew how to build a fire,make a tent and normal survival stuff but she never knew that it was actually going to happen. She spread out a blanket on the ground and let Emma play with her toys there. She started to look around to see if there was anyone was there or if there was a plane in the sky that could rescue them. As the days passed Violet had already built a little tent out of mud and sticks they were running out of food so Violet stopped eating so Emma can eat and be strong. Emma was already learning to walk so she wanted to walk everywear, so Violet decided that they would take a walk to the beach and Emma would play and splash in the water. Violet looked longingly at the road then a black jeep  was passing the road very, very, slowly.
“WAIT,WAIT’’ yelled Violet as she picked up Emma and started sprinting toward the black jeep. As she got to the car a man rolled down the window she looked at his shoulder and gasped she couldn&#39;t believe her eyes! He was a policeman.
“Hello may I help you” said the policeman “Bob.
“ umm ya, a week ago me and my mom and my baby sister got in a car crash, and we couldn&#39;t find my mom and our car broke down can you please help us?’’
“ So you are saying that you two girls that have been missing’’? 
“Yes’’ Violet replied.
“ Well hop in and we are going to get you and your baby sister some food and try to find some place that you can stay awhile.”
“ Thank You so so much but can we go get our stuff first”?
“Sure go ahead I’ll wait here.’’ Said Bob. 
As Violet ran to their campsite she was so grateful that a car came to save them, she packed all of their stuff. Then she put Emma in the stroller. When they came to the back jeep the policeman came out and helped them with their stuff. As Violet sat in the passenger seat of the car she thought.I am so so lucky that me and Em are safe that that the police came to save us and now we are going to live with dad and everything will go back to normal, except for mom she will always have a place in our hearts.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="Ashton H." tags="" position="502,23" size="100,100">&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\

    The beginning?\
&lt;/div&gt;
“Want to hang out after school?” I asked Patrick, my best friend since elementary school. “Sure!” he responded quietly.
“Alright so war thunder*?”I asked
“Yes!” pat responded again.
I looked at the clock at the front of the room but before I could read it the bell rang. I walked out the door with patrick.
“So how are the girls?” asked pat.
“As always.. Call me edgy and emo yet we are friends” I responded.
I opened the door to my house and let pat in. we walked over to the computers in my office and started playing War thunder

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
    The beginning.\
&lt;/div&gt;
I woke up to patrick shaking me. “What is going on?” I asked patrick who seemed to have a horrified face.
“The FBI is here!”he said.
I chuckled. “I will check”. I looked out the window and the SWAT team was there!
“COME WITH US! WHOEVER IS IN THE HOUSE!” 
We were alone in the house. My parents were on vacation.
We hear them crash down the door.
“Quick! Out the backyard!”I say as we run to the backyard door.
“Get on the ground!” a soldier yelled.
I pushed open the glass door. We climbed the fence and ran. Running… we ran for a long time… we heard them behind us… we had to go into the forest. “GO TO THE FOREST QUICK!” I yelled. “Why the forest?!?!”he yelled back. “It is the best way to lose them!”
“Alright!” he yelled as we both ran into the trees. The trees were everywhere. Still… running. “This should be good” I said as we walked to an abandoned campfire.
“We should get rest.” pat said.
“Yeah.. it&#39;s been a long night.
I struck a match and lit the campfire.
“Good night” he said and fell asleep.
I looked at the campfire. And heard a weird noise. Sounded like a war and pulsing. It was not loud but soft. I looked at pat and his eyes were glowing.
“What the..” I mumbled to myself.
“Probably my mind playing tricks” i said as i layed down and slept.

    Things hiding in front of your eyes.\
&lt;/div&gt;
I woke up to the sound of helicopters. “PATRICK WAKE UP!” I yelled.
“ALRIGHT TIME TO RUN”he said.
We ran but i felt weird. I let go of the feeling and pat and I were suddenly at a lake. 
“What?”we both said.
“I feel weird” pat said.
“So do I” i said. 
“I feel I can do more…” pat said. And right as he finished the sentence his eyes looked like clocks.
“Heck?” I said.
Pat screamed “BOI YOUR EYES ARE RED”
I suddenly felt powerful and I looked at my hands and I was a wraith.
“Cool!” we both said.
But then I blacked out.
Darkness.

“Hello?”I said as I woke up. 
“hello “ said patrick.
“We have been captured and so have the girls and quinn and evelyn.”
“What?”
“You heard me!”
“Alright” i said but as soon as I got up I heard. //&#39;&#39;SUbject 001 to testing room 1 .&#39;&#39;//
“That&#39;s you”he said. I walked out of the room to the room right across.Testing room 1 . I walked in and got in the chair. I heard a click then i&#39;m now on an island? Confusing yes i know deal with it.

	So… you are probably questioning EVERYTHING right now… so let me explain.
It turns out that I blacked out the whole facility and that allowed my friends to escape. I am a wraith like thing now… Pat is a god of time. Yongjin is literally a god. Emmie is an art god, millie and mya are anime people now. Evelyn is an angel. And natalie is a meme goddess. I can&#39;t say much real or they will find us again so cya.
I guess this is the start of something big.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
	The end?
    Book 2 coming soon
Probably not.
But maybe...\

		“Mom why do we have have to move?” I said.

“It’s dad’s job don’t you want him to be the head of the head of the company.” replied my mom.
My dad had gotten a promotion in his company. That is why I was at the dinner table in Brookings and not in my old home in Texas. Headquarters were in Portland but my dad grew up in  a small town and wanted me to be the same. So that is how we ended up in    Brookings, Oregon. It is only going to be 70 degrees that is like winter weather in Texas. But in the winter it would get down to 40 degrees. I was not excited.
We, just had are pasta and I was about to go to my room to unpack when my mother said” we are going on vacation to Alaska”

“What, When.” I yelled.

“We leave tomorrow, Surprise.” My mom replied timidly. 

“ I need to go pack” I said running up the stairs.

“We packed for you.” My dad chimed in.

“Set your alarm for 6:00 am., we will have everything ready. Go to bed.” Said my mom in a patient voice.

“Okay” I said excitedly.

&lt;/div&gt;
The night went by in a blur. When I awoke I realized what was happening. I was going to Alaska to ski. I got my clothes on a blue t- shirt and jeans with my everyday sneakers. My dad had made pancakes and bacon my favorite. 
We got everything in the car and were off. When we arrived at the airport we saw the time 7:23, no the plane is leaving at 8:00. We ran down the crowded airport and to the plane. We just made it on the plane. My mom had to plead with the air control officers but they let us on. I went back to sleep all I could think about was how fun it is going to be.
Once again I was woken up, but this time by my mom. “Honey we are here.” 
I walked out of the airport amazed by all the snow. It was everywhere.
“Hurry up we need to meet the uber driver.” Said my dad in a hushed tone.
When we met the driver we got in the minivan and headed to the lodge. When we got to the lodge. I was so happy it was amazing. The grand hallway is filled everywhere with artwork. The rooms had two queen beds and a bunk bed. I took the top bunk. I always did. I didn’t have any siblings so I could always. We had dinner in a restaurant. I got a mini pizza with pepperoni. It was 7:30 pm. But my parents sent me to bed. 
“You need to go to bed, tomorrow we are up at 5:00am to ski.” Said my dad.

“Fine” I said sadly. I was off to bed.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.clker.com/cliparts/V/B/3/B/t/B/purple-hill-hi.png&quot; width=&quot;400px&quot; padding=&quot;5px&quot; alt=&quot;Mountain Photo&quot; /&gt;\

    &#39;&#39;Part 3&#39;&#39;\
&lt;/div&gt;
 When I woke up with the alarm blazing in my ear. I can’t wait I thought. I got in my thermals and I grabbed a protein bar and joined my parents in the equipment room. We had been fitted for boots the night before and were getting everything on. I got ready and got in the helicopter and waited for my parents.Adrenaline was rushing through me. When the motor started we were off. When the guild found where he wanted us to ski we landed that was fun I thought. We were getting ready to go and I wanted to turn back. But I couldn’t. So I went. The snow was so deep. I fell then the world went black.
When I woke up, I couldn’t find my parents anywhere.
“Mom, dad” I said quietly.

Mom, dad” I screamed. I began to cry. When I realized that crying won&#39;t help I stared at mountain. 

“Where are you guys.” I whispered under my breath. Then I saw a white blur of snow. I figured out that it was an avalanche. Run I thought. The avalanche was destroying everything in its path and I was next.
I ran and ran till I was at the beginning of a cliff. Then I jumped. When I felt the impact everything went black. When I woke up my body was aching all over. I forced myself up. I walked around. I saw all the ruins. Then I saw the lodge. 
What happened I thought. I walked around the lodge for signs of my parents. When I had given up and sat on a stump. Then I saw my parents.
̈ Mom, dad. ̈ I said.

¨Honey.̈ My parents said in unison.
We went to a hotel and had a cup of hot cocoa. All together as a family.

Im Jason, Jason Roberts. I am 12 years old. I&#39;m going to a baseball game in England for the championships. I was erging to win the game. My parents said I was tall. But im only “5 feet tall! Im at the airport, Running to the dock. “ plane 3389 will be leaving in 60 seconds” The intercom said. On the way to the dock I hit some people. I was lucky I got on. When I got on the plane the captain said” please find your seats quickly!” My seat was #D3. I sat down very quickly. The plane was really kinda small. “ We are lifting up” The captain said.
 After two hours of flying, the airplane sirens started beeping. The pilot came over the speaker and told everyone to prepare for a crash landing. The plane was going down, And quickly too! “ BAM!” The plane slammed into the ground. I was out for a good 30 minutes.

&lt;/div&gt;

	I got up. My neck, leg and arm hurt, badly. My hands were bleeding, my head had 3 bruises. I went to check on the captain. He was… dead. When we were going down he pressed the low oxygen button. He never noticed he pressed it. I walked out of the plane. Birds chirped, deer ran around, bunnies were everywhere. The tall trees made shade for animals. The flowers were so pretty.“ Woah!!!” I exclaimed. “ This is so pretty!” My eyes could not believe what they saw. “ What will I do for shelter?” I thought. “I could try to find tree to sleep in it or big sticks for a shelter.” “But what about food and warmth?” I panicked, I was thinking to hard, I was stressing myself out. “ Calm down Jason” I said to myself. “I should just go exploring and get to know my surroundings.” I went around the forest. I saw some pretty flowers while I was exploring. It started getting dark. “ Oh no, I don&#39;t know what to do for shelter or food!” I exclaimed. I was shaking and worried. “ I guess I could build a fort really quickly.” I said to myself

&lt;/div&gt;
“CRASH!!!!” A tree branch came down. I dragged it all the way back the the crash sight. I put Branches over the door and windshield of the airplane. I kept the medkit so if I get hurt I can use it. I slept in one of the seats of the airplane. I was thinking about tomorrow to build a real fort and take a chair and put it in there. I went to sleep. “ Chirp chirp chirp” sang the birds. I woke up. I left the airplane. I went exploring in a new way. “ BERRYS!!!!” I yelled. I ran as fast as I could. I panted as soon as I got there. I grabbed 2 handfuls and ran back. I was so happy, I started tearing up. I ate 5 of them. “ I should save up, I don&#39;t know how many are left at the bush, I could run out before I know it. I was scared, I was worried, I was shaking. Not because I was cold, because I was scared, and in pain. “ I don&#39;t know what to do.” I said softly to myself. I guess I will just figure it out in the morning.

&lt;/div&gt;
I woke up the next morning. I got barely any sleep last night. I was so tired. I knew I could not sleep any longer though, that&#39;s because I have to figure out what I&#39;m going to do for more food. “ What will eat besides berries?” I thought. I thought about making a bow. I broke off a stick from a tree. “ Nice thing is that it is a curved stick!” I said. I went back to the plane. I found some string. I carved off all the bark. I tied the string to the ends of the branch. I found some arrows in the plane. I tried the bow on the fish that I took out of the water. The bow did not work. In fact it broke. I went back to the plane to eat some berries. I started crying. “ Why did I have to be trapped, and lost and alone?!?” I cried out. I cried for another 20 minutes. “I-Is anybody there?” I heard from the front of the plane. “C-captain are y-you there” I ran to the front of the plane. I saw a radio. “ H-hello, are you there?!” I said very shaky. “Are you ok?” The man on the radio said.”I need help! I&#39;m stuck in the Sherwood forest! Please send help. I was on the 3389 voyager plane, we crashed, Please help!” I cried out. “ Ok. I am sending a rescue plane after you. Do you have a single to tell them you are there?” The man asked. “ I have a bright flashlight. The plane can also be a single” I said quickly. “Ok. Sending the planes right away. It will take around 2 hours to get to you ok? Stay there, Don&#39;t move. Also be safe” The man explained.

&lt;/div&gt;
I waited and waited. I thought they would never come. What if they pass over me and don&#39;t see me and im stranded here for longer. Maybe for the rest of my life. I Panicked. I was very worried. I hear a plane around. I went outside and turned on my flashlight. It started coming down. The plane landed. The pilot came out. “ Come on kid, Get in the plane.” Said the pilot.I was so relieved. It&#39;s been 2 hours of flying. We land at the dock. I run out.”Hahahahah!” I was so happy to be back to society. “ um sir” I said to the pilot. “Is this England?” I asked. “Yes it is. I thought you liked baseball, so I took you to the finals.” Said the pilot. “Thank you! I have to go win the game!” I said with lots of energy. I ran to the field.

The score was 10-2. It&#39;s been 2 hours, AND WE WON! I was so happy for me and my team. I scored the last point! My team went on winning games and won the finals 3 times in a row. We went on the baseball gig for 2 years.

    Chapter 1\
&lt;/div&gt;
One bright morning a girl named Gemma who was 19 woke up from a dream. Her dream was the most wild dream she had ever had. She had dreamt that she was climbing a huge mountain and found a cave full of gold and  treasure. It was one of the best and most vivid dreams she’d ever had. Gemma got out of bed and headed down stairs to get breakfast. 
When gemma got down stairs, she fixed her self two pancakes, a scrambled egg, and two pieces of bacon. After thinking about it Gemma decided to go on the adventure to prove to herself that the dream wasn’t real. Gemma went upstairs again to pack. She found the largest hiking backpack she could find. Gemma started filling it up with clothes, water, and food. She also had to figure out what to do with Snowball, her pomeranian. Eventually she figured out she would have her parents watch Snowball. She drove fifteen minutes to her parents house and dropped off Snowball. They asked why Gemma would be gone and she replied with
 “ I’m going on vacation.” 
“Ok.” “Have a nice trip.” her parents said.
 With that Gemma went home. When she got back, she decided she would go to the mountains tomorrow.
	After dinner Gemma went to bed. She set her alam to get up at 6:00am, because tomorrow she would get up, load her stuff and go to the mountains. Gemma lived in Colorado and the mountains were only two hours from where she lived. Gemma was very excited and nervous at the same time. She didn’t exactly know what  to expect. 


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt;

	The next day early in the morning Gemma got up even before her alarm went off. It was 5:02am. Gemma decided to get up,  get dressed and start loading the car with her stuff. It was still early when she finished so Gemma decided to go to her favorite cafe that opened at 6:30 and that was exactly what time it was now. Gemma hopped in her car and drove off.
She arrived and quickly sat down. She was very tired from packing. A few minutes later her blueberry muffins, croissants and cup of coffee was given to her.
After eating she realized what time it was and had to leave immediately. It was 7:34 and she was supposed to leave at 7:00. In a hurry she paid for her food and left. Gemma got in the car and left for the mountains.
	About two hours later she arrived at the mountains. Gemma unloaded her stuff and started her hike to the mountain in the distance, which looked exactly like the one in her dream. 
Close to halfway through the day Gemma reached her dream. Right in front of her was the mountain. The one in her dream. Gemma hooked up her gear and started her climb. As she started up the mountain she quickly got tired from hiking. She found a safe ledge and decided that she would set up her tent and take a nap. Soon that nap turned into bedtime.
When she woke up the sun was out and it was bright and early. Right away Gemma continued to climb. She had to take a drink of water every hour so she didn’t get dehydrated. As Gemma climbed higher and higher she felt more and more tired. She didn’t know how long it would take to reach the top but she knew she could do it. The tiring journey has only begun and Gemma had just hoped that she wouldn’t die. Worrying was the last thing she needed to do. For now reaching her dream is what’s most important right now. 

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 3\
&lt;/div&gt;
Gemma noticed that as she climbed higher and higher it got colder and colder, forcing her to put on more and more layers of clothes. 
“ It sure is cold.” Gemma mumbled to herself.
Very soon she was covered in scarves and sweaters and other heavy clothing. The temperature wasn&#39;t the only thing changing. The weather was changing a lot too. Heavy snow was falling making it hard to see. This was a little more challenging. Gemma got out the flashlight she packed and continued to climb.
	At one point Gemma thought about giving up and climbing back down to go home but it would kill her if she didn’t find out about what she thought was real. Thinking about that made her have courage and want to keep going.  Higher and higher she climbed. Days and hours passed by. The peak of the mountain was within sight. Gemma estimated about  another  ten thousand foot climb before reaching the top. Although she couldn’t see a cave, Gemma thought she might as well climb to the top anyway. 
After two more hours it was getting dark out. Gemma didn’t know what to do. There was no place for her to rest. If anything, Gemma might have to just hang from the rope that she was attached to so she wouldn’t fall. What made it more nerve racking is that she’s so high up that if her rope broke it was certain death.
Just before falling asleep, Gemma thought she saw a cave. At first she thought she was dreaming, but the closer she got the closer the cave got. Soon Gemma reached the cave. She wanted to explore but it was too late. Gemma set up her tent and tried to go sleep. It took forever for her to fall asleep. Especially not knowing what was inside that cave. It bugged Gemma so much that she got out of bed and went to explore just a little bit. Gemma went far into the cave. Gemma thought she saw something and decided to pick it up but it was just a rock. Assuming nothing was there and the cave was safe she went to sleep.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt;
	When Gemma woke up the next morning and decided to explore the cave once more. She grabbed her flashlight and started off. Gemma went deeper and deeper into the cave. 
“Whoa.” said Gemma when she found a gold coin.
It came to her attention that there might be more. So further and further she went, until she reached the end of the rainbow.
“My dream!” Gemma yelled excitedly.
 Gemma had started to collect the treasure when suddenly she heard
“Grrrrrrrr” 
and again
“Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrr”
Then out of nowhere a tall dragon about fifty times her size appeared. It was red and huge. Gemma didn’t know what to do. She slowly backed away. The dragon slowly crept forward toward her. Then...SNAP! Right at the bag Gemma had put all the treasure she found in. Then she realized that the treasure must have belonged to the dragon, but Gemma wanted to keep what she had. The dragon came at her once more. Gemma would have to fight for her life. 
	The dragon threw it’s talons at her and Gemma just ducked and dived trying to dodge the dragon. She kicked and punched as hard as she possibly could. The dragon swooped up behind her and picked her up. Gemma thrashed her body around hoping to free herself. The dragon took Gemma to the darkest corner of the cave were she couldn’t see and she dropped her flashlight when she was fighting the dragon.
	All she could think about right now was to get past that dragon. It was not only guarding the treasure but her along with it. She had to make a plan and very fast because Gemma needed to get out of the cave as soon as possible.



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 5\
&lt;/div&gt;
After thinking for a while Gemma had come up with a plan. Right now the red dragon was asleep. On a scrap piece of paper she wrote down the escape plan.
Throw gold coins to distract the dragon
Quickly and very quietly sneak past the dragon
Get to the area of the cave with light fast ( the dragon is very light sensitive.)
Pack tent, water, food and go
With quick motion Gemma threw coins at the dragon to wake it up then past the dragon to distract it. Then she flew past the dragon running as fast as her legs could go. Gemma ran faster and faster and faster, until she reached her campsite. In the distance she heard a really loud roaring from the dragon. It was furious. Gemma had only gotten the tent disassembled when she saw a huge shadow of the dragon from around the corner. The dragon got closer but quickly stumbled back because of the sunlight. Gemma finished packing and hooked herself up to the rope and right back down the mountain she went.
	The farther down she went farther away the dragon was. Climbing down would take days again. Gemma had managed to keep the treasure she took, but she also kinda felt bad for the dragon. At the same time she decided that her life was more important. 
	 

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    5 days later\
&lt;/div&gt;
Gemma was almost there she could see the bottom of the mountain. It was so close. She estimated it would be an hour before she reached the bottom. Gemma couldn&#39;t believe it. She couldn’t wait to pick up her beloved pet snowball and get to her warm cozy bed at home. It was so close. Just a little farther. She hit the bottom of the mountain. The climb was over and she was glad. Her arms and legs were very tired. The only thing left to do now is to  take the long hike back her car so she could drive home and be safe from any more danger.

    Chapter 6\
&lt;/div&gt;
Gemma unhooked herself from her climbing gear and tucked it away in her backpack. As she began her hike, Gemma must have made a wrong turn because it seemed like she was walking forever and ever and she didn’t remember the hike being this long. Gemma stopped to get her compass out but when she looked in her bag it wasn’t there. She realized she forgot to pack it. All Gemma knew was that she was lost. Gemma was also worried that she might never be found. She also knew she had to go north to get home.
	The thing for Gemma to do now was wait. She figured that if she waited for night time the north star would appear and she could follow it home. A couple hours later it was finally night time. Gemma looked around the sky frantically until she saw it. The north star.
	Gemma followed it for hours. Then she finally saw civilization in the distance. She was happy and thought she was lucky to be alive on the treacherous journey.  The closer she got to home the happier she was. Gemma was almost there. 
	When Gemma got there, started to unload her stuff and put it in the car. It felt good to have all that weight off her shoulders. She got in her car and drove off to go pick up Snowball and go home. It was four in the morning. On the way she decided to stop by the cafe that was open all night and pick up a muffin and a good cup of coffee. Then she continued on her two hour drive home.
	Gemma had just arrived at her parents. 
“ I’m here to pick up Snowball.”Gemma said.
“ Here he is.” said her mom giving Snowball to Gemma. “ How was your trip?” asked her dad. 
“Good.” Gemma said.
“I’m glad.” both her parents said. 
“ Well I have go now.” “bye.” said Gemma 
“Bye.” her mom and dad said to her.

    Chapter 7\
&lt;/div&gt;
Gemma got home with Snowball. They both got settled and Gemma went downstairs to watch a movie. Snowball followed and sat with her. They snuggled up together and soon they fell asleep. 
	The next morning when Gemma woke up she found the gold she got from the cave and that&#39;s how she knew her adventure wasn’t a dream. Gemma was glad to be home safe.

&lt;/div&gt;
“Help,” I called. Right now I am in the corner of my living room that was now 1,000 degrees. I screamed as I felt the flames lick up my back and engross me in a deadly hug. “ Help, help,” I screamed with all my might as the blanket of searing flames stretched over me. My throat was hoarse from screaming so loud and for so long. I took a deep breath of the smoky air and gave a last yell. I fell to the ground like a boulder and then heard whispers so soft I thought I might be imagining them.
“Autumn, Autumn honey, wake up,” I gasped as my eyes flicked open like eager grasshoppers jumping about. “ Mom, what are you…. Oh,” I suddenly realized that it had all been a dream, the fire, the smoke, all of it. I let her wrap me up in her arms as her chilled fingers brushed my back like a warm fuzzy blanket. “ It’s okay honey, just a bad dream.” I closed my heavy eyes and it felt as though a brick at been lifted off my eyelids. Before I knew it, my eyes were closed tightly and my mom was half asleep next to me. I let her envelop me in a hug and I drifted off to sleep.





“Autumn,” I heard in a soft voice. I  pivoted on my foot and turned to face  Sky, my best friend. I am at my middle school now, North Star Middle school. “Hi,” I answered to Sky. Sky is my best friend. She has been since 4th grade. That’s 4 years running, so I basically turn to her for everything. The only time things get a little awkward is when we talk about academics. Mainly because a couple of attributes that describe Sky are, smart, smart, and smarter. Sky is the smartest in the school and her teachers have even thought about having Sky go straight to Highschool. But, I’m pretty self-confident so I don’t really think about that too much.
“Autumn,” Sky exclaimed, pulling me out of my trance. 
“Sorry.”
“ Anyway, what did you do this weekend?” Sky questioned
“ Nothing,” I said plainly.
“ Autumn come on, pay attention. What are you thinking about anyway?” 
I thought about not telling her about the dream, I just couldn’t get it out of my head. I just kept picturing the flames licking up my back and how realistic it all seemed. 
“ Well, I had this dream…” 
And I explained the whole thing. How my skin burned when the flames crept up my back, how my throat stung as though a million needles where there poking at my skin. 
“ Okay?” Sky said uncertainty.
“ Well,don’t you think it&#39;s weird,” I questioned.
“ What do you mean, do I think it’s weird, it’s just a normal dream.”
“ Well, I just can&#39;t stop thinking about it. I&#39;m not sure if it was just a dream.”
“ Autumn, you&#39;re not making any sense. You said you fell asleep, had a dream woke up and realized it was a dream. How could it not be a dream.” 
“ I&#39;m not sure, it just felt so realistic.”
“ Well, I&#39;m sure every dream does.”
“ Whatever,”  I said.
 I was so confused, why didn&#39;t Sky understand? She was my best friend, she always understood. I remember in fourth grade when I was scared of small dogs and she understood that. Now she doesn&#39;t understand when I am confused about a dream? 
None of this made any sense. I glanced at the clock and checked the time, 7:09. I had 6 minutes before the first period started. The first period was math, where we were getting, our tests back. Great another C. I bet that Sky will get an A+



	“ How did you do on the test,” I asked Sky.
	“ Good, A+, how about you.” 
	“ Great, A,” (I was so excited about this that I had started to talk to Sky again even though she had been crazy and not understood me.) I know she got a better grade than me but, I still got an A. It definitely beat the normal C.
A couple of hours later I was walking home from school still excited about my A in math. I just couldn’t wait until I got home to show mom how well I had done. “ Mom,” I yelled, storming through the door. 
I gasped as I looked inside; there were tissues everywhere, pillows were on the floor, and my dad’s briefcase was thrown on the carpet. It definitely looked like someone had left in a big rush. I suddenly wasn’t thinking about school anymore I was now thinking about what had happened. 
I ran in every room and both my parents weren’t anywhere to be found. I ran downstairs and sat on the couch, I wouldn&#39;t move until they were home, and when they where they would sit and explain what had happened; why they had left in such a rush, why they didn’t tell me they wouldn’t be here when I got home, and why dad had left early from work. 





The cold, icy brittle tears streamed down my face like a rushing waterfall. I had been sitting on this snow-white, warm, comforting couch for 4 hours. I spent most of the time crying. With every hour that passed, I cried a little harder until I had cried an ocean full. All I wanted was for my parents to come home, but once they did get home I wanted to go back; go back to before that day had even happened.
As soon as my dad walked in the door I could tell something was wrong. I knew that when my dad walked in the door without my mom that something terrible had happened; I knew it was worse than a little mishap at work, I knew it was worse than a long lost relative I had never seen having a heart attack, I knew it was worse than any thought that had crossed my mind when I had been sitting on the couch for 4 hours. I knew it was worse.
“ Dad,” I questioned? “ Dad what happened.”
“ Honey, I-I.”
“ Dad, what happened.” I wasn&#39;t sure if I should ask but I had to know.
“ Well, your mom-she, um. Well, it was terrible.”
“ Dad! Dad, what happened, I need to know.”
“ She, she, she’s gone.”
“ What! Dad.”
“Honey sit down let us talk.”
“ No!” I could feel my eyes fill with confusion, but I yelled anyway. 
I knew that she wasn’t just my mom. She also Dad’s wife. So, I knew he was going through the same thing as me yet he was probably going through even more because he had to tell me, which in his defense I was not very receptive. 
I ran upstairs and cried. I cried until my eyes were dry and then I slept, woke up and cried some more. 




	
By the time I was completely awake and I didn’t have a tear left in me it was 8:05 am on Tuesday. I gasped. I had been in my room crying and sleeping for almost 10 hours. I was also late for school and my dad hadn’t even cared. I felt anger rise up in my chest. The feelings inside me seemed to be saying, “ Don’t do it. Don’t go downstairs you will see him.” I really wanted to obey this order but at the same time, my stomach was saying,” Feed me! Feed me!” 
In the end, my stomach overpowered and I crept down the stairs and took a quick glance in the kitchen and raced over to the fridge. Wait. Something was not right, I thought my dad had been in his room crying just like I had but it was way too clean. “ Hi, sweetie.” I practically jumped out of my pants when I heard dad’s voice. Not knowing what to do, I ran up the stairs as fast as my stiff legs would carry me. 
I’m not sure why I did it that day. I just don’t know why. I could have said,” Hey Dad,” and have had a meaningful conversation that maybe could have calmed me down a lot. But, what’s done was done and there is definitely no going back.
Once upstairs I finally found my tears again and cried and cried and cried. With every tear that dripped down my sobbing face, I felt my eyes sting like little needles.





	It was here after all this time finally the day was here. I just couldn’t believe it. Today was the day of my mom’s funeral. You’d think it wouldn’t make much of a difference. I knew she was dead. The thing is, I haven’t really thought about what death meant. This just really puts things into perspective. I feel like I really needed this, to put things into perspective. Even though it has been a whole month since the accident I have still been secretly hoping she would come back.
	I haven’t been to school yet other than one day. It had been last week. I still wasn’t on speaking terms with dad yet. I could just see the pitty for me in his eyes I HATED it. Yet I had had to ask him when I would go back to school. Not that I wanted to but I had to know. I had asked him in one simple word. “ School?” He had replied with, “ Well, I was thinking maybe you go next week. From there we could see how it goes. So, is Tuesday okay?” That was the only time we had spoken. 
	The day I had gone to school I had barely made it an hour in and I started balling in the middle of math class. It just brought back the memories of when I got that A. I had been so excited about myself I hadn’t thought about anyone else. If only I could’ve been sick so mom would have come to get me and she wouldn’t have gotten in that terrible car crash. 
 But, right now I wasn’t focusing on that. I needed to focus on this funeral. I was going, I had to go. I had contemplated over if I was or not but I had to go. I needed to escape today with at most one word to dad. 
I got into the black limo and scrambled way to the back. The limo was filled with family members I didn’t bother to talk to. 
Dad had had a family member over every night for the past two weeks. I had figured out a way not to talk to any of them so I knew I could avoid them now. 





	“ Leave me alone!” I shouted as I scrambled up the stairs. I just couldn’t believe it. We had been at the funeral and my dad had tricked me! The burning I feeling that was now so familiar in my eyes came back to me. 
	“ Just go, go and never come back. Just like mom!”
	“ Autumn, come here. You need family right now.”
	“ No! I don’t.”
	“ Autumn, please talk to me. I will never open my mouth again if you just sit down for 2 seconds.”
	It was too late I had already slammed my door shut and left him in his sorrows. I just couldn&#39;t stop thinking about what he had done at the funeral. 
	I had fallen asleep. Of course, I didn’t want to but I hadn’t slept that night. The memories of my mom kept creeping back to me. Anyway, dad had picked me up and carried me to the car. I know it doesn&#39;t sound bad but when you were so mad at them you thought about not going to your own mom’s funeral and then that same person carried you it drove you a little nuts. 
	I felt the longing of sleep creep over me and I fell into a deep trance. 






	“ Autumn.”
	“ DAD!”
	Right now my dad was cuddling me on the couch like a little baby. I leaped out of his strong arms ad onto the stairs. I hoped he NEVER talked to me again. 
	Then I rethought it. It was true I NEVER wanted him to ever look at me again. But, maybe if I talked with him for just 1 minute. I would never have to deal with him again.
	“ Dad,” I said in my tiniest, smallest voice.
	“ Yes,” he sounded so hopeful I couldn’t turn back now.
	“ If I talk with you for 1 minute do you promise not to force me to talk to you again until I want to,” I really really got my hopes up and so I feel my heart sink like a boulder when he replied.
	“ Honey I wish I could.”
	“ Then don’t talk to me.”






	I had finally done it. I had gone back to school again. It had been really hard for me but I think I can do it this time. 
	“ Sky,” I practically screamed as I saw the familiar rush of joy bustling in the hallway. 
“ Sky,” I said again, louder this time. I didn’t get it. Was she ignoring me? 
“ Sky,” this time even louder. 
“What Autumn,” I was surprised at her tone of voice. She was the first person I had talked to after the accident, other than dad once. 
“Um, Sky.”
“ Get to the point.”
“ Sky, what’s wrong?” 
“ What do you think is wrong,” Sky said in an alarming tone.
“ I’m not sure,” I questioned.
“ You left me for almost 2 months. No text, no emails, no calls, no visits; then you come back and assume I’m just going to gladly be your friend again; no.”
“ Sky please try to understand. My mom died,” I whispered tears starting to swell like berries.
“ Sure, that’s what you said.” She emphasized the you just right to make her sound like the most sophisticated one here.
“ What are you saying?”
“ I’m saying I think I could come over to your house to your precious mom welcoming me at the door.” She emphasized the precious just right to make her sound like the most sophisticated one here.
I just couldn’t believe her. I, went/going through, the hardest experience of my life and according to her, I’m making it all up? The only reason I had wanted to come back to school was to see her and now she can’t trust me. I am officially never going back to school. 
Since I didn’t want to go back to school I had no choice I had to talk to dad. I knew he wouldn’t make me go back if I asked him.





“ WHAT!” Dad had just told me that I had to go back to school. I had just poured my heart out to him about how I feel about Sky. 
“ Autumn, you have been doing much better about getting over your mom and since this is just your social life I have to say no. All girls have social problems, I know you just lost your mom but I’m sorry it doesn&#39;t give you a pass.”
“ I haven’t talked to you in weeks and when I finally talk to you to ask a favor you say no!”
I stormed up the creaky stairs and I slammed my butt down on the chair. I had so much homework since I had been gone for so long.





	It was finally Friday after all of this it was finally Friday. Now all that was left was to get through the last 30 minutes of Friday.
“ Autumn, please pay attention.”
“ Yes, Mrs. Bronson.”
I am in math class right now but I just can’t stop thinking about the end of school. It just couldn’t come fast enough. “ Ring,” that was the bell to end the 6th period. I walked into the hallway looking both left and right to make sure there was no Sky. 
	“ Oh look there’s Autumn, the liar. I wonder what she’s thinking, probably thinking about her mom and how she ‘died’,” she put quotation marks around died.
“ Stop Sky; remember when we used to be friends?”
“ Oh yeah, when I tried to help a pathetic little brat from failing middle school. But the job was, obviously, impossible.”
Her and her little possy walked away laughing like Sky was the funniest, best person in the world leaving me in my sorrows, and with hot bubbly tears pulsing through my eyelids. 
I ran outside of the school and away. I don’t know where but I just kept running, I ran away from everything; away from my life, away from home, away from school, away from Sky, away from dad, away from home, and away from everything.







	I cautiously entered my dad&#39;s room to make sure she was still in a deep sleep.  I looked over on to his bed, he was sleeping as though he hadn’t for days. I crept into my mom&#39;s closet which still had her same buttercup smell, and was overwhelmed with emotions, but then I remembered why I was in here, to grab her scarf. I snatched her blue and pink scarf from the shelf and tip-toed out back into my room. 
I reached into my back jeans pocket and pulled out the lighter I stole from the gas station hours earlier. I flicked it on with ease and set the scarf to burning flames. 
I burst into tears. I was overwhelmed with emotions and I just couldn&#39;t stop it.
“Mom,” I said through sobs,“ Mom, come back.” 
It slipped. The scarf slipped. Right out of my hands. 
“ No,” I screamed. Suddenly the whole room burst into flames. I heard Dad call my name from outside my room but I couldn&#39;t call back. I ran over to the corner of my room where my desk was positioned. I tried to type, how to get out of a burning room, but I couldn’t do it, turn like a crack of lightning the corning was enveloped in flames. I squished myself far into the corner trying to keep out of the searing flames reach. 
I suddenly thought of kindergarten; when a firefighter came and told the class that if we were ever in a room, or anywhere with fire to stop, drop, and roll. I wondered if it would work to get out of this room. I rolled across the room and felt the stinging feeling envelop me like a devilish hug. 
I popped out in the hallway and ran downstairs. But, the flames were catching up to me. I ran into the corner of the living room and smooshed myself into the corner. My head was spinning like a tornado. 
I am in my backyard. No, in my front yard. No, in the living room.
Wait what? I had decided on a conclusion, I was in my living room. Wait-kitchen-no. 
It reminded me of something. I just couldn’t put my finger on what it was.“Help,” I called. I screamed as I felt the flames lick up my back and engross me in a deadly hug. “ Help, help,” I screamed with all my might as the blanket of searing flames stretched over me. My throat was hoarse was screaming so loud and for so long. I took a deep breath of the smoky air and gave a last yell. I fell to the ground.







	I woke up in an icy cold be in an environment that smelled like nasty medicine. My eyes fluttered open like eager butterflies. I took in all of it to realize I was in the hospital. I saw my dad sitting at the end of the cream-white bed. My burns were wrapped in white bandages that also smelled like medicine. 
	 I opened my mouth. I opened my mouth and told Dad everything. how I felt; why I had done what I had done and so much more. We talked for 3 whole hours. In the end, everything was resolved. Of course, some of it could only heal over time but we had come up with so many solutions. 
	For example, we had decided I would go to a new school, that I can make new friends. We had also decided for me to get a counselor to help me with things like school. After that, we had decided I would never do what I had done, that I would always be on speaking terms with dad because he was there to help me, not offend me.
	After hours of talking, I cuddled up in the cold, hard hospital bed and drifted off into deep comforting sleep, with all of my problems resolved.

	“Josh honey, come eat your lunch. You have been packing all day.” Said Josh’s mother.
	“Fine mom!” Replied Josh.
	
14 year old Josh Daniels was going to go on a trip of a lifetime. He was going to Greenland to visit his grandparents because they could no longer live in America. Their taxes kept raising up and could no longer afford to live in Rhode Island with his family.  

“I can’t wait to go see grandma and papa!” Said Josh while he was stuffing a sandwich down his mouth. 

The next day, Josh had to get up at the crack of dawn because of how early his flight was.  His grandparents were ecstatic to see him and he was ecstatic to see them. When Josh finally got to the airport he could not believe his eyes. He had never been to an airport before and it was HUGE! But when he saw the plane, he knew he was ready to go. Josh finally got on the plane and he could not believe it! He was going to go see his grandparents all the way in Greenland. 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt;

	“Please take your seats now! We are going to leave in two minutes!” said the flight attendant.

He was ecstatic. Josh never would of thought this moment would come and then the plane was off before he knew it.

	The plane ride was very relaxing for the most part. A little boy would sprint around the plane though which was very annoying. But then, a very disturbing message came on the speakers. 

“BRACE, BRACE, BRACE! THE PLANE HAS AN OIL LEAK! THE PLANE WILL CRASH! BRACE,BRACE, BRACE!!!”

No, not here, not now. Josh thought. He was going to crash and most likely die in this plane. 

	It was in a blink of an eye, he looked down and all he saw was trees as green and white as a christmas tree in the winter. Everyone was screaming their heads off but Josh stayed silent. Finally, the plane crashed and Josh blacked out. 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 3\
&lt;/div&gt;


“GIANT, GIANT WAKE UP!!!”

Josh snapped open his eyes and he saw a blurry little boy. He screamed in shock. He was still alive! But when he saw who was talking to him, he wished he wasn’t alive. It was the little boy screaming and running around the plane. 

“OH NO!” Said Josh. 

“HELLO!” Said the little boy, “My  name is Evan and you and I are the only ones who survived that horrible plane crash.”

“Oh um, hi, my name is um, well Josh and um yeah.” Said Josh.

“OK!” Replied Evan. “What are we going to do? I have no survival skills.”

“Neither do I. But stay close to me. I have no clue what is out here.” Replied Josh.

“O-ok.” Answered Evan sounding a little more scared.

	Evan and Josh started to travel through the cold forest just trying to find somewhere they could make a decent shelter. 

Finally, Josh and Evan found a very nice little lake in a surrounding area of LOADS of trees which will be a very nice place because predators might not find them here.

“YAY! WE FOUND A PLACE TO LIVE!” Said annoying Evan excitedly.

“Good god! Would you give it a rest already! Aren’t you tired!?” Answered Josh irritably  

“NOPE!” Replied Evan.

“Oh.” Said Josh.

Night finally came and Josh was relieved, maybe Evan would finally shut up for once and his life. But he did not. 

“GOOD NIGHT JOSH!” Said Evan.

“Night.” Replied Josh.

But then Evan started to dance for no good reason! When morning finally came, Josh hardly had any sleep. Evan was sleep talking and it was quite annoying. Josh let Evan sleep and  decided to go drink some water and see if there was any food around. When Josh came back, Evan was awake and looked more hyper than normal.

“GOOD MORNING JOSH!” Said Evan very loudly.

“Morning Evan.” Said Josh annoyed.

“WHAT WILL WE DO TODAY? Are we going to find food?” Asked Evan.

“Hopefully.” Answered Josh.

Just then, they heard a noise. It was a noise, a noise that sounded like a howl. Wolves. Josh thought, It had to be wolves.

“AHHHHHHH!” Screamed Evan.

“SHUT UP!” Said Josh in a hushed voice. 

“Ok.” Said Evan quietly.

The wolves were close, he knew it. More howling and it was getting closer. But something happened that Josh never would of expected, there some kind of scratching on the wall of their yurt. The wolves could smell them. 

“We have to run! We are outnumbered. They will kill us if we don’t leave now.” Said Josh in a worried voice.

“O-o-ok.” Said Josh in an even scareder voice.

Then, they ran as fast as they could out of the backside of their yurt. The weird thing was that the wolves were nowhere in sight when Josh looked back. Just as he was thinking that though, a wolf jumped on his face and attacked him.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt;


Josh woke up with a fright. He was still alive from the wolves. But he did not have all of him. He looked down and his foot was gone. He screamed in shock. But then Josh wondered something, where was Evan. He wasn’t anywhere in sight. But the wonder Josh had ripped him to his core and made him kind of pleased. They took Evan. He knew he had to go find him but where would he be? Josh kept yelling his name but there was no response. When Josh came back to his abandoned yurt he was absolutely shocked! There was Evan eating a wolf that he had cooked!

“Evan! What the heck are you doing! I thought you were dead!” Said Josh in shock.

“MMPH, nope! I thought you were though! You were on the ground cold, With no foot!” Answered Evan.

“B-but how did you survive from the wolves?” Asked Josh still stunned.

“Well, I found this really big stick, and started to whack all of the wolves with it until they ran away! Answered Evan.

“Than How did you get that wolf!?” Retorted Josh.

“Oh, this wolf? This is the one that attacked you and took your foot so I kept whaking him until he croaked! So then I took him back, and cooked him with this pot I made!” Said Evan cheerfully.

Josh was stunned, he couldn’t believe that a SEVEN  YEAR OLD BOY could do this! But sure enough, silly, little, clueless Evan did. Night finally came that night and Josh was beat. He had no foot, covered in scratches, and was starving because Evan kept the wolf to himself.

“GOOD NIGHT JOSH!” Said Evan in his normal cheerful voice.

“Night Evan, sleep well.”

Then they both drifted off to sleep. The next morning came and it was another annoying night, Evan was snoring the whole night so Josh got hardly any sleep. He was extremely hungry this morning so he was determined to go find some food. It was just his luck though because he found part of a dead moose not far away from is shelter! Josh happily took the moose back to the shelter where he found Evan making a fire.

“You have got to be kidding me.” Said Josh.

“Morning Josh! Oh good, You found food!” Said Evan.

“HOW ARE YOU SO GOOD AT THIS SURVIVAL STUFF?! You said you had no survival skills!” Responded Josh.

“I don’t! It is just coming naturally!” Answered Evan.

“Oh.” Said Josh.

“Shall we cook this?” Asked Evan pointing at the moose

“Oh, um yeah sure.” Answered Josh forgetting he had the moose.

Josh went outside to go get some water and when he went to do that he saw a moose in the lake. The moose was huge and could easily kill him.

“Hey Evan, come see this moose!” Said Josh.

“WOW! THAT THING IS GIGANTIC!” Said Evan.

The noise seemed to of startled the moose and it stared right at Evan as if he wanted to kill him. The moose started to run towards Evan at such force. Josh and Evan were both standing stunned, but then Josh snapped out of it and told Evan to run for his life. Evan started to run but he was no match for the quickness of the moose who ran faster and finally got to Evan and charged its antlers into Evans head which made Evan knock out. The moose ran away in an instant just as Josh ran over to go see if Evan was ok. But he wasn’t, he was out cold.

	Josh ran to go find something to stop the bleeding and to wake Evan up but he ended up coming back with some leaves to just stop bleeding. When Josh examined Evan, there was no sign of breathing or movements. After ten minutes of trying to get Evan to breathe, he gave up, he knew Evan was dead.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 5\
&lt;/div&gt;


	Josh took Evan back to the yurt with a thought of sadness. Evan had been Josh&#39;s only person to talk to around here and now he had no one. He was all by himself and had to survive by himself. If it wasn’t for Evan, Josh wouldn’t be alive right now, he wouldn&#39;t have food or good water. He went to a pile of dirt, and buried Evan, knowing that it was partially his fault that he died. 

	Josh had to move on now, he knew he had to. He remembered hearing the co-pilot say that they were close to a village. But which way? Josh thought, so he waited till night when he could smell fire. Josh remembered the last night when he smelled some type of fire going on up North and heard some kind of music. So he knew that was where he had to go. 

	The next morning Josh woke up with a jolt of excitement, he was going to go find a village up North. He got the stick that Evan had whacked the wolves with, grabbed some berries, drank some water, and went on to go find a village. It was about sunset when Josh finally heard it, he heard some singing and he smelled some fire. Josh started to run on his one foot he was so excited! He couldn’t believe it, he was going to find a village where they would take care of him! When Josh came to the village though, he found it wasn’t a village, it was a camp with an indian tribe in it and they did not look too happy to see Josh. They looked very mad and had their bow and arrows pointed at Josh’s chest.

“HEY, HEY, HEY! I COME IN PEACE!” Said Josh with his hands in the air.

“WHY SHOULD WE TRUST YOU? WE DON’T KNOW WHO YOU ARE! THEREFOR, YOU ARE A HUGE THREAT!” Said one of the indians. 

“I swear I&#39;m not a threat! I don’t even have a weapon!” Said Josh cautiously. 

“Ok, I guess you have a point. But what do you want from us?” Asked the indian.

“Well here’s the thing.” Said Josh.

	Then Josh told the indian what had happened to him and what he had to face.

“Oooooooh.” I see you have been through some tough times.” Said the indian.

“Yup, I definitely have had some tough times.” Responded Josh.

“Ok, but that still does not answer my question. What do you want from us?” Said the indian again.

“Well, I was wondering if you could try to get me home but if you can’t, than just take care of me.” Said Josh.

	The men talked about this for a very long time and finally the same guy answered Josh by saying that they would find a way to get him home but he would stay with them for the night. Josh was very pleased by hearing this. He was going to have a decent place to sleep for the night. But at that moment, he remembered about Evan, he had to go retrieve Evan so when they went to go home, Josh could give Evan to his grandparents.

	When morning came Josh was extremely excited, he was going to go home! He and another indian went to go get Evan and when they came back, the Indians discussed a plan to get Josh home.

	The chief finally came up to Josh after they all stopped discussing and said that they would use the plane they had to take him back to Rhode Island.

“We only use this bush plane in case of emergencies!” Said the chief to Josh.

“O-ok. So when will we go?” Asked Josh.

“As soon as we get fuel in it!” Answered the chief.

“Ok.” Said Josh excitedly.
	Josh couldn’t believe it! He was going to go home!


		The plane ride was a success, Josh had made it to the Rhode Island airport and when he got there, he could not believe his eyes. There almost a thousand people there taking pictures. When Josh had gotten out of the plane, he spotted his parents right away. Josh dashed over to them and hugged them as hard as he could. Tears swelled up in his eyes and he was about to cry. That was when Josh knew he was safe.

&lt;/div&gt;
One day I was inside my house playing fortnite VR, when something surprising  happened. I got an email from a mad scientist saying that he had invented a new machine and that I was the chosen one that gets to test the new machine. 
So I grabbed my hoverboard and went to the Mad Scientist&#39;s  lab. When I got there, I recognized the scientist, he was my father! My father had gone to jail for many years. He just escaped from Alcatraz. He tied me up on a chair he gave me a knife and said “Have fun!” then he pushed me into a time machine luckily I pulled my hoverboard in with me. 
When I woke up I was in a caveman cave. 
“Where am I” I said. I saw a big family of cavemen. Everyone wanted to kill me except for one of the kids he looked like he was 14 just like me.  He protected me against his own family. I asked him “Where am I?” 
“We are in dinosaur land” the boy said. Then he carried me up a hill where there were 4 more cavemen they also wanted to kill me but the good caveman started talking to them, they all understood. When everything calmed down I saw why the good caveman said that we were in dinosaur land. I saw a herd of big brachiosaurus in a lake drinking water and eating tree leaves.
 We headed back to the cave and had pterodactyl for diner. After dinner I asked him what was his name, and he said “My name is Shane.”  
“What’s your name?” he asked me. 
“My name is David, but you can call me Dave”. The next day I helped the family hunt we were looking for triceratop eggs. We found the eggs but then me and Shane heard noises behind some bushes there we saw a man riding on a big T-rex he was holding a staff with a blue gem on it. His Staff also had four other holes on it, where jems could go.  we saw him get off his T-rex and send the T-Rex inside a cave. Then he started walking, when all of sudden he vanished into thin air! I asked Shane “Where do you think he went”.  
“Sometimes magical portals appear everywhere and you came through one of them,” Shane told me. That was the weirdest thing I have ever seen in my life the second weirdest thing in my life the most weirdest thing is when my dad pushed me into the time machine. After we got the eggs we headed back to the cave and had breakfast.
I asked shane, “Can we go explore?” 
“Yes, that way you can see more things,” Shane said. 
But really I just want to find my hoverboard. “Take me where you found me,” I told Shane. When we got there I could not see it but then a baby velociraptor went right past us faster than usual I looked under him and there I saw that he was riding my hoverboard.” 
He was so scared.
“Can you get the little dinosaur off the floating thing, without hurting him?” I asked Shane 
“Yes, I’ll try,” said Shane.
Then he threw a bone and hit the ground next to the hoverboard, the baby velociraptor went out flying, I started running and caught the baby velociraptor while I was falling backwards then the hoverboard landen on my stomach it hurt. But what really matters is that the dinosaur was ok.
“Are you OK?” asked shane.
“Yes I’m fine,” I answered
Then we heard footsteps behind us, and after a big “ROAR!!” we turned around and saw an angry velociraptor with armor, then the baby velociraptor ran at the angry one and started talking to him he understood that we were friends not enemies than the angry velociraptor carried Shane back to the cave while me and  the baby took a ride on my hoverboard.
When we got back to the cave Shane’s family wanted to eat the velociraptors for lunch but Shane started to defend the dinosaurs but this time his family was way to strong and went after the two velociraptors but luckily I saved the baby. Then the family went on top of the dinosaur when all of a sudden we heard a loud “ROOOOAR!!” shane’s family quickly got off the velociraptor and ran inside the cave.
“run!!”
“Wait I recognize that roar”Shane said.
“Yongjin is that you?”
Then a cavemen climed of a T-rex for a second I thought it was the man with the staff we saw this morning but no this cavemen looked younger.
“Shane, little brother” said the cavemen.
“Little brother?” I asked shane.
“Yes he is my older brother, his name is Yongjin” Shane said
“Grunt grunt grunt grunt?” Yongjin asked shane in a caveman language. 
“Gr gu gr grunt grunt” Shane answers.
“Hi my name is Yongji, what’s your name” Yongjin said.
	“My name is David but you can call me Dave”
	After meeting each other we went back inside the cave and had velociraptor for lunch. Then I remembered about the other velociraptor and thought that I had just had one of my friends for lunch. Then I just hurried outside and there found the two velociraptors sleeping I threw them a big piece of triceratop meat. They woke up right away after the loud “BANG”.
	The next day I woke shane up. 
	“We should give names to these velociraptors” I said.
	“You name the small one I’ll name the big one,” Shane said.
	I then started started thinking on what to name her I thought bella was a good name but then I saw her run so fast that I wanted to call her speedy but then she bit my foot right away I screamed and took her off my foot when I was holding her she tried to bite my nose. When I let her down she started chomping on everything.
“Chomper” I yelled
Then right away the baby velociraptor turned around and started jumping happily.
“You like that girl” I said
“You know that’s a boy name right” shane said
“Yes I know but she chomps on everything so I decided to name her chomper” I answered.
“What did you name him?” I asked shane pointing at the bigger velociraptor. Then shane started thinking right away.
“Got it” he said.
“I am going to name you buster” he said pointing at the big velociraptor.
“Buster that’s a good name” I said.
Then yongjin came outside and went over to where he had left his T-rex an got on his back he started riding away towards where the man with the staff disappeared so me and shane started following him in secret Shane was riding on buster while me and chomper rode on my hoverboard I noticed that chomper really liked my hoverboard.
	Shane just randomly stopped and I wasn’t looking but when I turned around I had to fly over him. Then we saw yongjin he also disappeared we walked right on top of his footsteps then we went inside a big bortal ahead we saw yongjin then he just disappeared.
	“Where do you thing he went?” I asked shane.
	“I do not know” Shane answers.
	“Let&#39;s just keep walking forward and see where does this portal takes us to”I suggested. Then all of a sudden we appeared right behind yongjin who was spying on the man with the staff. 
	“Why are you spying on this poor man?” I asked him.
	“Because he is my worst enemy only with his staff I can return to my old friend to live” he answered sadly.
	“Did he kill your friend?” I asked him
	“Yes” he answered back. We stood there watching the man with the staff as he started to walk towards his staff carrying a dead man on his arms.
	“Stop it right there” Yongjin yelled as he came out from his hiding spot
His big T-rex followed him.
	“Why would I” said the man with the staff while he made the dead man float over the staff.
	“Rexy come out and help me!” he yelled while he grabbed a stone and threw it up in the sky from the stone came out a big T-rex.
	“Dave catch” he said as he pased me a stone.
	“What do I do with this?” I asked yongjin.
	“Just throw it up in the sky and say a dinosaurs name” yongjin acleard to me as he trhew shane a stone.
	“Do the same that I told Dave” he told shane. Shane nodded.
	“Allosaurus help me out here” I said throwing the stone that yongjin gave me the big allosaurus came out almost breaking my hoverboard.
	“Arcovanator come and help me” Shane yelled throwing the stone up in the sky.
	“Rexy atack the T-rex” Yongjin orderd Rexy the other T-rex ran at rexy and tried to bite him but rexy is too fast and doged his atack
	“Allosaurous help rexy” the big battle begined the arcovanator ate the man with the staff. Rexy and allosaurus defeted the other T-rex yongjin quikly grabed the staff and returned his friend to life
	 “Can the staff return me home?” I asked.
	“ Yes” yongjin’s friend said. Pointing the staff at me he shot a green ray of light the ray hit me but nothing happend.
	“Nothing happend” I said.
	“I gave you the power to call me, shane or yongjin” yongjin’s friend said.
	“You can also call any dinosaur you want to help you” Yongjin’s friend added.
	“ I take chomper with me?” I asked Shane
“Sure, after all you named her” shane said.
“What’s your name?” I asked yongjin’s friend.
“My name is kyle” he said
“Come here chomper” I yelled she ran tords me and jumped on my arms.
“Ready” I told kyle he shot a blue beem of light and hit me after that I found myself in my room comper was with me but she didn’t look like chomper she looked like a dog.
“Chomper!” I yelled and the dog transformed into a velociraptor. Then mom came in and said where were you? You where gone for 1 hr. “One our that was 4 days back at dinosaur land” I thought.

  It all begins when I arrive at school ,when I do not even see my teacher ready to take us to her classroom . Five minutes later my teacher arrives at the school with Starbucks coffee . I am like what you were five minutes late for coffee what.Then she takes us to her classroom we all are putting our stuff away then she gets upset and yells sit down you&#39;re taking forever . After that it&#39;s been a week she starts getting me in trouble for no reason  she even kinda starts not to believe me .

 When I tell her something she says go get me more proof.After that I had enough so I told my parents and they said okay try one more day and if something doesn&#39;t go  right then we will talk to the director. The next day she is mean again so you know what after the day is over I told my parents and the next day we talked  to the director and he did not believe us so one day he entered the classroom so he saw the teacher yelling at us then the director got so mad so he talked to the teacher so the teacher got so mad that he found out she was getting mad at us . 5 weeks later she yells at us again but we are now used to her yelling . Then we all started hating her so we said we will just wait till the end of the year then we will leave this school.
 So after that the teacher got even meaner so the director had to come again.The next day I arrived at school the director asked me how I was doing then I said I am doing good .After that I said goodbye to my Dad .While I was walking down the hallway way the director started talking to my dad while I was walking down the hallway I was  wondering  what will happen today .  So arrived at class and um i catch the teacher so angry and I went up to her and i said are you ok and she just looked at me in a mean way and said strongly I am fine now go sit down and I just said ok back so I went and did what she asked me to do . 
After that it was time to go to math class the math teacher was so nice we would always play games when we  are  done with learning it would be so fun . After math class we went back to homeroom  my teacher was mad as she always is but it really does not matter because we know she will yell at us again .It was lunch time when the teacher made us stay in for 5 minutes instead of going  to lunch but we did not do anything .It was fine we still survived we made it to lunch . Lunch was over  we made it back to class the teacher just made us sit down  she did not say anything and that was like for the first time in forever but that did not last long after 5 minutes she said i am so mad at you guys you never do anything right ever you always make me yell at you she was screaming at us for more than 30 minutes after she was done yelling she said we have to miss all of your playtime because you did not listen to me today.
 The next day came my teacher did not arrive me and my classmates thought will she come today then later we got the news that she might not even be here for the next 2 weeks . 2 weeks passed by it was the end of the school year the teacher felt so ad that she yelled at us this whole school year so she said I will let you guys pick what you want to do today since it is the last day of school and we all picked to go outside then come back in and watch a movie we all went outside even the teacher played with us looks like she really felt bad .After that we all started came inside and watching  a movie . 10 minutes passed by the director called me to come to his office I told myself no matter what happens you will be alright any ways it is the last day of school you do not  have enough time to  get in trouble . When I finally got to him he told me to sit down and I just listened to him . A few minutes passed by he just told me that I was a really good student and  that I had nothing to worry about . we talked for a little more after that  I had to go back to class. Once I got back to class I asked my friend what is the movie that we are watching and she said oh it is just a Tom and Jerry .
After Tom and Jerry we watched a horror movie . I was kinda scary but it could be scarier . After that movie the teacher had something for us she said that she brought in cupcakes for us . All of us were really thankful .  At the end of the day we had to go home. So we when we got outside all of us waited for our parents once our parents came we could go home . 3 minutes passed  by my dad came to pick me up it was sad I had to leave my best best best friend behind but it was okay because we could see each other whenever we wanted to but it is still sad because we have been friends since 2nd grade . so I said “goodbye” best friend see you soon”and she said “see you best friend I will miss you”. so she gave me something to remember her and I gave her something to remember me . We hugged for a bit then it was time to go . My dad said “let&#39;s go talk to your teacher” and me and my dad went  to talk to her .

The teacher said “hey um you were a good student this year but you really need  to work on turning in your home work “. My dad got really mad so he just talked to the teacher softly trying not to cause any drama .My dad said 	&#96;hey um I even see my child doing her homework
So don&#39;t you say that my child has to turn in her homework	“.
After that we all just talked and then we just decided to tell the teacher that we will be switching schools and the teacher was so surprised  that we were switching and so we told her why and she said that she was so so sorry and she begged us to stay and we said no but after what happened i don&#39;t think we need to  stay And so we switched schools.

	Chapter one:\
&lt;/div&gt; 
The weather was crisp and quiet when Barry was walking down the street. It was about 12:00 a.m. when Barry’s phone started to ring.”Hello?” Barry said in a confused voice. 
”Hi Barry,I know it’s been a while...Oh! By the way it’s Iris.” 
“Iris, what do you need? You haven’t talked to me in five years and now you just want to call me!” he said in a frustrated voice. 
“Look, I’m sorry, I know it’s been a while but I wanted to invite you on a trip with Wally, Me, and my new husband Harry.” she said in a soft voice. 
“Where?” Barry asked.
“To Victoria, Australia, we would love you to come please Wally misses you. I’m begging you.” Iris pleaded.
 “Sure. I’ll be at the airport at 4:00 o’clock ok?” Barry sighed.
“Awesome, thank you so much . I Gotta go now, bye.” She hung up and Barry was stunned he would be seeing his son for the first time in five years. He was exuberant. 
When he gets to the bar he orders a drink and chugs it. “I’ll buy drinks for everyone who wants one!” Barry shouted! Everyone started cheering and drinking. When Clifford came in, all the noise started to die down.
 ”Who is this infuriating person buying everyone drinks? That’s my thing!” Clifford said frustrated.
”I’m sorry I’m in a good mood.” Barry stated trying to calm Clifford down.
”Do you think I care? I’m going to teach you a lesson!” Clifford screamed He grabbed Barry and threw him through the window. CRASH! Barry was bleeding and limped away. 
When Barry  gets to his apartment he collapses and jumps back up and yells.”I get to see my son!”

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter Two:\
&lt;/div&gt; 
Four hours later… HONK! “Get out of the way I gotta get to the airport!” There is a bunch of traffic at Central City International Airport because of fall break. When Barry finally arrived he was exhausted from getting thrown into a window, packing, and driving to the airport. When he walks in he sees Wally and Iris and was very anxious about talking to them.”Hi.” Barry said nervously.
“Hi Barry, I know it’s been a bit but Wally wanted you back in his life.” Iris said softly.
“Well I’m happy I get to see my son again.This is going to be a great trip.” Barry said excitedly.
“Well the plane is leaving in ten minutes we gotta go now!” Iris said.
They rushed to the plane and got there just on time.	
“I’m so sorry I forgot to introduce myself I’m Barry.” Barry said shaking Harry’s hand.
“I’m Harry, Iris’s husband. I love Wally and Iris with all my heart.Don’t worry,I have been taking care of them I wouldn’t let anything happen to them.” Harry said.
When the plane took off, they started having a conversation on the plane  discussing the last five years. ”So what has your life been like the last five years?” Iris asked curiously.
“Well, my mother and father died in a car crash 2 years ago. Also, the rest of my relatives won’t talk to me because they think I’m an embarrassment. They think that because I don’t have the best job or the best wage at the weapons factory.” Barry said regretfully.
“I’m so sorry that is horrible you must&#39;ve been so sad.” Iris said sadly.

“Yeah, it’s been hard lately, I’m about to get kicked out of my apartment but I’m trying my best to survive.” Barry said.
“Guess what dad, I got the new i-phone 15 max and it is so cool I Love the new hologram facetime! It looks so good, it’s like their actually there.” Wally said excitedly.
“That’s awesome!” Barry said.
“Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.” Harry said. 
While Harry was in the bathroom they just sat quietly when they heard an ear-piercing explosion and out the window they see one of the wings on fire and they are about to crash. Everyone is screaming and everyone lunges forwards and Barry smacks his head on the chair in front and blacked out.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter Three:\
&lt;/div&gt; 
Barry woke up with Wally and Iris crouching over him. He saw tears in Iris’s eyes and wanted to ask what happened. ”What happened.” Barry said with a groan.
	“The plane crashed and pretty much everyone died. I can’t find Harry it’s like he just disappeared.” Iris said crying.
	“It’s ok we will find him and find a way back home.” said Barry hopefully.
“First of all, let&#39;s go look for food.” Barry said.
While they were looking for food Wally went to go find a place to use the bathroom. ”Where are the toilets in this place?” asked Wally.
	“There is no toilet in a deserted island.” said Barry.
Wally walked into the forest to use the ‘tree’ toilet, when suddenly he was grabbed from behind, “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH” screamed Wally.
“Were coming.” Barry sceamd.
	Barry and Iris ran and saw Harry taking Wally. When Harry saw Barry and Iris he cuelly smiled. Harry ran away with Wally and Barry chased after him. “Hey!” Barry yelled.
“You can’t catch me.” Harry said laughing.
Chapter Four
Harry ran and jumped off a little cliff and disappeared into thin air. Barry decided to jump off to but he kept falling and smack right into the ground. When he woke up he was in a pile of leaves and looked around to see a little lever on the side of a gigantic limestone wall so he pulled it and it opened up a massive underground lair.
	“What is this?” Barry mumbled to himself. He walked around for a little while trying to figure out what this place was when he saw Wally tied up. “Wally!” Barry said excitedly.
“Dad, look out!” Wally screamed. Harry came behind him and tried to hit him with a steel baseball bat but missed and hit Wally right on the head. “That’s it” Barry yelled. He picked up a sword that was on a metal table and swung it at Harry and Harry dodged it and pulled a lever that made both of them shoot up into the sky. They were wrestling in the sky when they fell back down onto a cliff. “Give it up Barry you will never beat me I set this whole thing up. I calculated every possible outcome that could happen and every single one I win.” Harry said. 
“No! I will beat if it’s the last thing I do. Why would you do this, did you set this whole thing up?” Barry screamed angrily.
	“Yes I did actually. It was quite easy, I had to convince Iris to marry me be with her a couple years. Kill your parents. Then, ask to go on a vacation with you. Then, I put a bomb on one of the plane wings and boom we end up here and all of you die.” Harry said laughing hysterically. 
	“You killed my parents! You must of miscalculated because I’m going to rip you to shreds.” Barry said angrily. Barry jumped at Harry and cut his arm and tried to go for another hit but got hit in the gut by the bat. Barry got back up and punched him right in the face and Harry stumbled back right on the edge of a cliff. “I will get you back for this!” Harry yelled.
		“Well it’s over.” Barry said. He stabbed Harry in the heart and pushed him off the cliff and left. He finds Wally and Iris sitting down on a gigantic stone waiting for him. When Iris sees him she gives him a big hug and then pulls away. “I’m sorry I don&#39;t know what got into me.” Iris said embarrassed. 
	“It’s ok.” Barry goes up to Iris and kisses her.They walk back down to Harry’s lair and finds a helicopter and they fly all the way to Victoria,Australia and have an amazing time. 6 months later… “I now pronounce you man and wife, you may kiss the bride.” said the minister. “What’s it like to be Iris West-Allen again?” Barry said happily.
“Amazing.” Iris said kissing Barry. After the wedding Barry and Iris walked out to there car and see a hooded figure staring at them. Barry couldn’t see it’s face but it took out some kind of object and threw it to the ground and some type of mist and everyone fell. “Ahahahahaha!” The hooded figure said with an evil laugh.

	Chapter 1\
&lt;/div&gt;
	Whiskers rubbed his cheek up against my face as the blinding, golden sun came in through the hot pink curtains. “I’m not ready to get up Whiskers” I whispered aloud.
Then I heard thundering feet coming up the stairs in our small apartment. The door was thrown open, “Start packing, Maddie, we’re going on vacation!” My mom said excitedly.
“Our boss said we get a week off! It’s the first week we’ve gotten off in years!”  My dad said.
I sat up immediately, “Really?!”
“Yes! Isn’t this amazing?!” Mom said.
“Yeah!” I exclaimed.
I packed my bag and Whiskers came over to me purring. 
“I’m sorry you have to go to Aunt Sally, you can’t come on the plane to Georgia.”
“Why not?” He seemed to say.
“I know. Come on; into your carrier.” He walked right in and sat down; I rubbed his black head and shut the door on the cage. I picked up the carrier and my bag and slowly walked down the stairs.
“Off we go then!” My dad said excitedly.
We dropped Whiskers and his stuff off with Aunt Sally and off to the busy airport we went. As we drove my mom told me we were going the long way over the ocean… in a really nice plane.
Soon we were on the plane flying over the busy streets of New York. Then It turned to pure, blue ocean. 
For forty-five minutes I slept. Then my mom shook me, “Wake up, you have to listen to this announcement.
The pilots voice was calm, “Good morning, please remain calm; we have lost one engine and are emergency landing on an island two miles east of Virginia.” 
Oh, this can’t be good… 
Apparently our landing gear wouldn’t work either because our plane dived into sand, nose first. As we landed my head hit the seat in front of me and everything went black.






&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I jolted awake. Where was I? What happened? This wasn’t right. 
	“Mom? Dad?” I looked to my left. I shook them both as hard as I could. Nothing. I walked up and down the aisle and called out, “Anybody there? Is anybody alive?” Tears came to my eyes, no one was there except me.
	“Are you all right?” I heard a raspy voice call out from the front of the plane. It was the old pilot.
	“Yes.” I called and ran toward him. His white curly mustache and sleek white hair reminded me of my grandfather.
“We must go.” he told me, showing me to the door. As we walked out a wave of heat hit me. It was cool in the plane, completely different from out here.
“We wait for fifteen minutes then we go find a place to build shelter.” I nodded, unable to respond. “It’s going to be alright.”
We waited and he continued to talk and try to soothe me. Still no one came, no rescue or more survivors came. Just us.
“Before we go, I want you to know that my name is Frank.” This I could respond to. “My name is Maddie.” I whispered back.
“I’m sorry?”
“It’s Maddie.” I said louder.
“Very well then, Maddie, let’s be on our way.”
	Frank and I walked through the green jungle. As we walked I kept quiet and thought. Mom and dad wanted to go on vacation, it was the first chance they would have gotten off work. But they’re dead. It didn’t seem to fit together in my head. It wasn’t right.
	Frank stopped behind a bush and signalled me to crouch. I edged closer to him and stared outward.
	Creatures fifty times their regular size, bees buzzed by, a giant jaguar jumped from a tree to the ground, and I saw a large hole, easy for a human to fit in, probably made by a worm.
	Then I heard breathing over head and Frank and I both turned around. There stood a giant white bunny. I almost screamed then realized it looked like Cottontail from Peter Rabbit. Cottontail was my favorite character.
	“Ahh, look at the cute little thing. It’s afraid just like us. Mr. Frank, we could ride on her and she could show us to safety and we could name her Cottontail!” I said.
	“Yes, yes, I suppose so.” he replied.
	“Woohoo!” I cried as we rode on Cottontail through the jungle. “Hold on Mr. Frank… Can we go faster, Cottontail?” She understood and she started galloping.
	We rode to a small clearing in the jungle. A place that was quiet. A stream ran on 
my left and there were flowers all over the place.
	“We could build shelter here! Cottontail, this is perfect! It’s safe and beautiful!”
	We slid off of Cottontail and I pet her nose. 
“Can you gather logs and small fallen down trees?” I asked her. She seemed to nod and then she hopped away.
“Let’s make a lean-to. We’ll build it on this tree right over here. We’ll make it big to put a fire in it.”
“Cottontail has gone to gather trees and logs for it.” I said.
“Yes, great.”
By nightfall the lean-to was made. Maddie and Frank crawled in and Cottontail’s big, fluffy body blocked the entrance, keeping the lean-to nice and warm.



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
Chapter 3\
&lt;/div&gt;
	When I woke up I was shivering. Cottontail was gone, so was Mr. Frank. Where are they? 
	I walked out of the lean-to, Cottontail and Mr. Frank were huddled around another fire. This one was bigger. It was chilly outside in the morning jungle of greenery.
	I hurried over towards the flaming, ornge, and red fire. I snuggled up against Cottontail’s warm fur.
	“Today, we’re building a more protective shelter. We’ll use wood from the lean-to and we’ll get Cottontail to get more logs to.” Mr. Frank said. “And please just call me Frank.
	“Yes sir, Frank.” I said.
	We stabbed the poles of logs and old trees into the ground. It created a hexagon of trees, like a little hut. The roof was laid upon our small hut. Next, we took large leaves of the massive trees, we laid them down as beds.
	We searched for food; finding berries, small bugs, and occasionally, a bird to kill and eat.
	“We’re gonna be here for a while…” Frank mumbled to himself. “Why don’t we go to bed and get some sleep; it’s almost dark.
	“Okay.” I said. 
	I read a book I had brought using a flashlight from my backpack. This story was called Night of Wishes. It was about a small girl, maybe five or six, but she was on vacation with her family. They were happy. They swam in the ocean and cuddled up with her parents at night to watch a movie. All her wishes came true and her life was happy, she had nothing to mourn over. She was the opposite of me, hopeless me.
	


	The next morning I saw Frank peeping his head out of the doorway. We figured it would be cold that night so we covered it with the same type of leaves we used to make our bed.
	“What’s going on?” I asked.
	“Jaguars.” Frank replied.
	“Hmm… Let me see.” I said.
	Two giant jaguars laid on the branch about three yards away, ready to pounce.
	“What should we do?” I asked
	“I reckon we try to scare  them away.” He said.
	“But they’re huge. And there’s TWO of them!” I said.
	“I know, but it’s our only chance of survival… Here’s the plan.” Frank said.
	“W-w-wait what, just like that?” I said. Then imitating his voice, “You get no say missy, here’s the plan…”
	“I know, I know, but we have to!” he said nearly yelling this time.
	“Fine.” I said.
	 We divised our plan and got on with it. We ran out our hut yelling and waving our hands above our heads, we threw things at them, and finally watched them leap away. I was out of breath and so was Frank.
	“We should find some water.” Frank said breathlessly.
	“Yeah.” I agreed.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt;
	A week passed and the same routine happened everyday: wake up, get warm by the fire, find food and water, explore, eat more food for lunch and drink some water, take a fifteen minute nap, explore, make fire, find food and water, eat dinner, go to sleep when it starts to get dark. Our schedule was not like school. It was basically eat, explore, eat, explore, sleep.
	One day Frank told me we should go on a hike through the island, the whole island. Frank new we were seven miles from the shore of Virginia.
	We packed our backpacks and hooped on Cottontail and rode under the wild canopy of the green jungle.
	As we rode I admired the colorful flowers. Green, gold, pink, blue. This world was incredible, yet nobody knew about it. I needed to tell them about it. But then they’ll come and kill them and destroy their habitat. But what if they were protected by the government, what if only a few people could visit a day? That is the way to go.
	Suddenly, Cottontail halted to a stop. A great, roaring river was beheld before us. 
	“Hmm, this doesn’t look good.” Frank said.
	“How are we going to get across?” I asked.
	“I do not know. Let’s move down the river to see if it calms down. Come on Cottontail.” Frank said.
	We moved slowly down the river. Wait we can’t bring Cottontail across the river, can we? 
	“Here we go!” Frank said, “This is so much calmer. Let’s but a bil tree across it.”
	“What about Cottontail?” I asked.
	“Oh. I guess we’re going to have to leave Cottontail here.” He replied grimly.
	“Okay. Bye Cottontail.” I stroked Cottontail’s nose slowly.
Cottontail helped push a tree over as a bridge for us to cross.
“Bye Cottontail!” I called out.
As we crossed I thought of what it would be like on the other side. So far all I saw was a forest. But Frank had told me there were vast mountains beyond the forest. He must have come or seen this place before, there was no other way he would know that.
I started shaking as I looked below down at the river, and then I slipped. I caught the tree bridge, but my feet were in the water. I yelped in surprise. Frank spun around.
“Grab onto my hand.” He yelled out.
I flung one hand up and snatched onto his hand. He yanked me up out of the water and we walked to land.
I sat down on the grass, my feet were sopping wet. They were cold. I needed a minute to breathe.
“You alright?” Frank asked me.
“Yes.” I said quietly. “I’m ready to continue.”
We walked through the forest. It felt like an eternity when we finally made it out of the forest. There before us were great shadowy mountains. Frank was right.
“Ready?” Frank asked me suddenly.
“Umm, yeah.” I replied hesitantly.
“Alrighty then! Let’s be going.” He said.
Off we went climbing and zig zagging through the mountains.



	By the time we got to the other side of the mountains, it was snowing and almost dark.
	“I think we better build shelter here for the night.” Frank said.
	I was chilly, the day we left, I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. Of course I brought a sweatshirt on the plane (because planes are always freezing) and I brought that in my backpack, but I was still cold in my shorts and sweatshirt, afterall, it was SNOWING!
	We built a small tent and fire and ate a little food we brought. That night, however, I did not sleep well. I kept thinking, how are we going to get back? My parents are seriously dead? What am I going to do when I get back, I have no parents? I also had nightmares all night so it was a relief to wake up. The snow had not stuck. That was one good thing.
	“We’re going to try to make a fire signal.” Frank said when we woke up.
	It was sunny, probably or nine a.m.
“Okay.” I said, I just went with whatever he said. 
We built a big fire. The smoke was so high and big I thought they would surely see it. But no one came.
“It’s not working.” I said starting to stress out.
“I know. We’re going to have to build a raft. I’ll find trees and logs and vines for the raft. You collect food, giant leaves and sand. Oh and get the leaf medicine from your backpack in case we need it.”
I moved swiftly towards a beach not far away. I gathered sand in my hoodie. I took leaves from a palm tree and gathered coconuts for food. When I returned, Frank had a large pile of logs and trees, along with some vines.
“Good job. We’re going to lay the logs side by side and tie them together with these vines. We’ll stick a log in the middle and tie leaves to it for a sail.”
We tied and built and gathered our supplies. We were ready. Ready to leave this 
beautiful island. We were off on an adventure through the wide, blue ocean.

Chapter 5\
&lt;/div&gt;
	The waves tossed us, but we kept looking ahead, to the shore of Virginia. The wind howled at us, “Stay… death is nearing…” It seemed to whisper. We kept on course.
	We came closer and closer to our new life ahead. We would make it!
	The people on the beach came into view. They saw us and started yelling. We were so close.
	We made it! Our raft hit the sandy beach. People wrapped towels around me and asked questions. Frank was exatrating our story. My only answer to them was, “I survived on this incredible island none of you knew about. Animals were fifty times their regular size and there were so many habitats and this is all true, you may think I’m crazy... But I dare you to boat or crash land on that island and live there for a week. Then and only then we you know how spectacular it is.”
	Blinding lights hit Frank and I’s face over and over again, it felt like it went on forever and finally it stopped. 
	We were flown to New York, where Frank’s wife, Lucy greeted us. I saw Aunt Sally, in her hand was a crate witch held none other than, “Whiskers!” I yelled. Aunt Sally wrapped me in a hug.
	“I’m so sorry.” Aunt Sally said. “I can take care of you from now on.”
	“Or we can.” A voice I recognized as Frank. “We could adopt you.”
	“It’s your choice.” Aunt Sally said.
	“Hmm… Aunt Sally, I think I’m going to go with Frank and Lucy.”
	“Alright.” She said and hugged me again. “But remember, your welcome any time.”
	“I’ll come visit. I promise.”



	Lucy and Frank’s house was big. It wasn’t an apartment.
	“What do you think?” Lucy asked.
	“I love it!” I replied.
	“Let’s go shopping for new clothes for you.” Lucy said.
	“Alright.” I agreed.

	Hi, my name’s Glaze, I’m a 15 year old boy who lives in his aunt’s house. Me and my sister moved here after my parents gone missing a few years ago. My aunt only loves my sister and doesn’t bother to care for me. My sister hates me as well just because she thinks im the reason our parents gone missing, and because of that my aunt spoils her and forgets about me. I am a loner in this house. I cook for myself and buy my own things. Whenever my aunt does take notice of me she makes me do things for my sister. But that all stops today! 
	The morning sun shone into the window as I tried to sleep peacefully. 
“Uggghhh! Wake up you stupid lazy dog!” My sister screamed in my ear as I woke up then looked at her. Oh did I mention my sister hates dogs? 
“Really? Wooowww classic.” I said drowsy as I went back to sleep. 
“UGH!” She huffed then stormed out of my room. Hah! Can’t get me out of bed that easily. I thought to myself smugly. “Aunt Wilmaaaa!” She called out to our aunt angrily. I heard our aunt coming up the stairs 
“What?” She asked her all time favorite niece. 
“Glaze is being lazy!” She huffed angrily. 
“Glaze! Get up right now!” She yelled at me as I got up then looked back at her. 
“What are you going to do huh?!” I challenged her. She gave me an angry glare then walked into my room. I could tell she was about to hit me as I prepared even though it didn’t look like it. She raised her hand to slap me until I looked at her then said 
“Don’t you know what a ‘law’ is? Its illegal for an adult to hit a person under 18 in other words a child.” She looked at me still angered. She put her hand down then walked out of the room. I looked at my sister and gave her a look that meant “I win”. She looked at me 
“Humph!” she turned then stormed down stairs. I looked at the time. 
“Oh I&#39;ve gotta get ready.” I hopped out of my bed then changed into my white sweater. I packed up all my things knowing today was the day I get out of here. 
	I hopped on my bed then opened the window. I looked back and got onto the ledge of the window sill. There is a tree next to my bedroom door that I can use to climb down. I carefully climbed onto the branch of the tree hoping the branch won’t bend or break due to my weight. I quickly made it to the trunk then looked down at the ground. This is going to be hard… I thought then tried to grab the closest branch that helped me get down. I kept climbing down the branches till I got to the one closest to ground. It was a bit high off the ground, but I think I can make the jump. I prepared for the landing then I jumped off the branch to the ground. I landed on my feet but then stumbled a bit then fell. I got up shaking the dirt off of my sweater then started walking to the forest by my aunt’s house.

   Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt;
I sighed as I reached the first tree by the forest. I looked back then continued walking. As I walked into the forest, I started to notice things. Like why is there a bunch of leaves? Why on the ground? Oh… I then realized that it was a trap. I sighed then walked around it. I continued walking then… I suddenly felt like the world was upside down. 
“I caught something!” I heard a voice say. I looked over to some bushes that kept rustling. What the? I noticed my foot was tied and I was upside down. A short boy with brown hair and a yellow jacket came out of the bushes. Followed by a tall girl with boy short black curly hair. 
“You didn’t catch anything! That&#39;s just some kid!” She told the boy.
 	“Oooohhhh… eh whatever.” The boy said then looked over at the girl “What are we going to do with him?” He asked her. 
“ I’ve got an idea! Get me down!” I yelled at them feeling my head started to hurt from hanging upside down for a little while. 
“Yeah, yeah, whatever we’ll get you down.” The girl said then climbed up the tree. 
“Wait What are you doing?” I ask worried
“Getting you down” She said as she untied the rope then let it go. 
I fell putting my arms around my head to protect it.
“Ow!” I said getting up looking at them. “Who are you?” I ask them glaring at the girl then the boy.
“Oh Im Lulu and this over here is Saturn” The girl said then climbing down from the tree. “And you are?” 
“Oh I’m Glaze.” I responded then grabbed my bag that fell when I got caught in that trap. “I should get going-” 
“Wait!” Saturn called to me. “Can you help us?” He asked.
“What?!” Lulu said shocked. I was almost as shocked as her. 
“Please? We really need it. You can admit that RIGHT Lulu?!” Saturn looked over at Lulu.
“Why are you looking at me? That&#39;s pointless! You’re blind.” Lulu said looking down to meet Saturn’s eye level. 
“Whatever, just we need help.” He said still glaring at her. 
“ Okay fine! But just be warned that he might be a murderer.” Lulu said looking at me “Lets go.” 
We walked through the forest from where their trap caught me. I think I still have that headache from that... Oh well. 
“My feet hurt!” Saturn complained as we walked.
“Oh come on get over it!” Lulu snapped at him. I sighed, why is it so hard to travel with these people? 
“Let&#39;s get to know each other more I guess…” I suggested to them. 
“Sure, I&#39;ll go first” Lulu said then sat on a tree stump. “I am Lulu and I am 15. I have learned how to use magic at the age of 7 and now I am a fully trained mage. I am human and I am apparently very tall. I can also-” Lulu kept going on until she was interrupted by Saturn.
“You talk about yourself too much.” He said looking at her. “Ima go now.” Saturn said looking at me “I am Saturn and I am 15 years old. I am blind but I’m also a seer even though I don’t look like one. I have one sister and my father is in prison.” Saturn ended it off.
“Oh that&#39;s… nice?” I said awkwardly. “ I guess I will start with myself now.” I took a deep breath then started speaking. “I’m Glaze. I’m 15 and I live at my-” I was interrupted by a noise coming from somewhere. Saturn and Lulu looked up and so did I.
“Hello? Who’s there?” Lulu called to the tree. Saturn froze, his sightless gaze looked at the tree and then he gasped. Saturn looked as if he calmed down. Saturn turned his gaze to me and Lulu.
“It’s fine. The person up there is harmless.” He said sounding relieved. 
“Wait there’s a person up there? Who? Do we know them?” Lulu asked a handful of questions that quickly got on my nerves.
“Shut up please. Of course we don’t know them! Like I don’t think you brought someone else out here!” I snapped at Lulu. 
“Well someone might have followed me and Saturn! I don’t even know why you decided to come along with us!” Lulu’s eyes burned up with anger.
“I shouldn’t have gone with a such annoying person like you!” I yelled at her with fury.
“Stalker!” Lulu yelled at me
“Stupid!” I yelled at her back 
“Oblivious!”
“Idiot!”
“Freak!”
“Weirdo!” The insults went on and on for a while until…
“Shut up both of you!” I heard a voice say.
“Saturn was that you?” Lulu turned to Saturn with a confused look.
“No! It came from up there I think” Saturn pointed up at the tree. I saw someone up there looking down on us. 
“Who are you?” I called up to them. They looked at me then climbed down the tree. The person was a girl with purple fading to pink hair color. She was wearing a light pink jacket and had a broken halo on her head. 
“No who are you?” She asked us with a confused look. 
“Oh I’m Glaze” I said looking at her.
“Im Lulu and that&#39;s Saturn” Lulu responded to the girl.
“Oh okay! I’m Angel. Don’t know why I was named that though.” She said looking at them. “Anyways, what are you guys doing?” She asked them. I looked at Lulu then Lulu sighed.
“Here let me explain,” Lulu said looking at her. “Me and Saturn set up a trap to get some food but then this doofus over here stepped in our trap and now we’re stuck with him. So now we have to get to know each other.” 
“Sounds great! Can I join?” She asked excited.
“Sure!” Saturn responded happily. 
“Okay ummm… so this weird ‘getting to know each other thing’ are you guys still doing that?” She asked.
“Yeah I think so” I responded then sat back down on the log. “Okay let me continue,” I said looking at them “I’m Glaze, I’m 15, and I escaped from my aunt’s house because she hated me. I can sense when something is coming but I can’t see into the future, and that&#39;s all” 
“Okay! My turn!” Angel said cheerfully “Hi! I&#39;m an Angel, I left my town because they mentioned that I was supposed to do something I cannot remember. I am an angel I mean obviously, but my halo broke recently due to accidentally falling into a river and falling out of a tree but not this tree. Oh and I am 15 as well” Angel finished.
“Well what now guys?” Lulu asked looking at everyone. 
“Uhh maybe we could… ummmmm” Saturn put his hand on his chin. I could tell he was trying to think of what to do. 
 I sigh as I looked up to the sky. It was pretty dark. 
“Guys why is it so cloudy all of a sudden?” I ask them to look back at them. They all look up. 
“Its just stupid clouds Glaze, stop being such a baby.” Lulu said looking back at me.
“You’re the baby!” I yell back the weakest insult ever created in history.
“Really?” She said raising an eyebrow
“Yeah!” I responded glaring at her, angry.
“Mouth-Breather!” She yelled at me.
“Brain dead!” Yep you guessed that more insults will be coming.
“Loser!”
“Freak!”
	“SHUT UP! BOTH OF YOU!” Angel yelled at us. I jumped up and Lulu’s eyes were filled with shock. Saturn looked like he was scared half to death. 
	“O-Okay… we will…” Lulu said her voice shaking a bit.

	We continued walking. I looked up to see the clouds getting darker. It’s most likely going to rain. I sighed then looked back to the trail. I noticed Saturn suddenly stop. 
	“Umm… guys? What’s up with Saturn?” I ask. They both stop then turn to Saturn.
	“Oh, he&#39;s getting a vision into the future, you know the whole seer thing.” Lulu said looking at me. Saturn shook his head then looked at us.
	“A bad storm is coming! We need to find shelter now!” Saturn warned. Saturn dashed forward.
	“Wait!” Lulu yelled then ran after him. Me and Angel did the same. When we caught up to him, he was standing in front of a kind of large cave but not so much. 
	“You think we could all fit in there?” Angel asked. 
	“Yeah I think so.” Lulu said looking at her. 
	“Just get in the cave please!” Saturn demanded then walked in. I walked in after him followed by Lulu and Angel. 




&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
   Chapter 3 ( Lulu’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I walked into the cave hoping nothing was already living here. 
	“It&#39;s so dark in here!” I heard Glaze complain.
	“Yeah that&#39;s the point of a cave!” I quietly yelled back at him. When we all got fully inside, Saturn sat down then sighed. I looked at Angel. 
	“Hey guys its sprinkling.” She said as she pointed outside. Okay so we’re stuck in here for a stupid storm that decided to show up out of no where. Great!
	“Soooo… what you guys want to do?” Glaze asked looking at all of us. 
	“Well anyone have any card games or something? What about uno?” Saturn suggested.
	“We do have a witch in our presence.” Glaze said looking straight at me.
	“What? You want me to make uno cards appear out of thin air?” I snapped at him.
	“Yep! Exactly that.” Glaze responded.
	“Ugh…” I reached into my bag trying to look for my spell book. I pulled it out carefully trying not to drop the fragile spell book. I flip the old written pages and tried to look for the right spell. I chanted the spell in my mind. After that a deck of cards appeared in my lap. I closed the spell book gently and put it back in my bag. I shuffled the cards then gave 7 to everybody. 
	“Are these uno cards?” Saturn asked me.
	“Yes” Glaze responded. We played the game for a while.
	“Uno!” Angel yelled out. I heard Glaze huff angrily. Glaze placed down a blue card in the pile of cards. I placed a yellow card which was the same number as Glaze. Saturn placed down a plus 4 card which meant that Angel had to draw 4 more cards.
	“What?!” Angel huffed.
	“Uno.” Saturn said a bit smugly. 
	“Hmph!” 
	I sighed then continued playing.
	“I win.” Saturn said happily.
	“How?! You can’t see.” Angel said shocked.
	“Magic!” Saturn said enthusiastically. I chanted a spell in my mind making the cards disappear.
	“We should probably seek out better shelter than this if there&#39;s such a big storm.” I said looking at Saturn, Angel, and Glaze.
	“Yeah you’re right.” Glaze responded.
	“Then lets go before the storm gets worse.” 
	We walked through the rain trying to find some sort of shelter. I put my hood on over my head trying to protect it from the rain. Saturn did the same. I laughed under my breath. I wonder how Glaze is feeling without a hood over his head. I turned to see Glaze soaked but was shocked and a bit mad to find him using an umbrella he probably packed. Dang it!  I turned and continued walking. 
	“Hey look!” I heard Glaze shout out. I stopped then turned back to him. 
	“What? Is it some wolf you want to go pet?” I ask looking at him.
	“No! It’s an abandoned house.” Glaze responded.
	“Lets go to it then” Saturn said walked towards Glaze. I huff then walk over to Glaze as well followed by Angel. We all followed Glaze to the house. When we got there, I walked up the steps carefully. I looked behind me to see no one was following me. They looked at me waiting for me to open the door. Of course I would be the first one to die if this house was haunted or something. I put my hand on the cold door nomb. I turned the door nomb a bit nervously. I opened the door slowly. It creaked then opened to reveal a perfectly normal house. I looked back a bit annoyed. The others followed me inside the house. I looked around a bit and sighed. 
	“Okay so what now?” I asked them.
	“Um maybe we could explore.” Saturn suggested. 
	“Sure.” 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
   Chapter 4 (Saturn’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I followed Lulu into the house, being careful of anything that might trip me. I didn’t really trust Angel to help me with these kinds of things, and Glaze had his own problems ( He was having trouble closing a simple umbrella ). I felt the warmth come over me, I must’ve entered the house. 
	“So what now?” Lulu asked us.
	“Maybe we can explore?” I suggested.
	“Sure.” Lulu replied. I walked around a bit, feeling a few things that were close to my surroundings. I brushed my fingers against something that felt like a picture frame. It seemed fresh and new, it didn’t have any dust on the picture frame. I walked over to Lulu and the others carefully. 
	“Everything here seems good and new.” I said looking at them sightlessly.
	“Yeah you’re right, the washer was washing some clothes that had just been put in.” Angel said worried.
	“Everything here is new. There are some items that were created this year and certain electronics such as a computer.” Lulu said suspiciously. 
	“This house isn’t abandoned at all!” Glaze came running down from upstairs. “Everything works perfectly! Nothing is broken.” Glaze said panting for air.
	“We need to get out of here.” I said a bit scared. I heard steps coming from outside, someone was coming…
	“Hide!” Lulu said a bit quiet but also a little bit loud. We all rushed up stairs. I looked for the nearest closet. I opened the door quickly. Everyone rushed in including me. I shut it lightly to make sure we won’t get trapped. I heard the door creak lightly. Someone entered the house and it wasn’t any of us. We were all squished in the closet scared. I felt Glaze shaking beside me. I was up against the wall of the closet while Glaze and Angel where in the middle. Lulu was in the other corner trying to get some room. I tried to do what I do and see into the future but it wouldn’t work. Why in the worst times does seeing into the future stop working?! I was scared. I heard someone walking up stairs then approach the closet. I panicked then tried to hide in the coats and shirts. The handle turned carefully. The door opened slowly…


	

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
   Chapter 5 (Angel’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I watched as the door opened slowly. I looked up to see a boy most likely the age of 18 or 19. He was glaring at us with a blank look on his face. 
	“Ummm… hello” I said awkwardly. 
	“Who are you people and what are you doing in my house?” He asked looking at each and every one of us. 
	“Here let me explain,” Lulu said walking out of the closet. She looked up at him then sighed “We were walking through the forest and one of our friends was a seer even though he doesn’t really look like one, so he predicted the storm, and so this guy over here spotted the house, so that&#39;s why we’re here.” Lulu explained.
	“Oh. Well I&#39;m guessing you saw every sign of a person living here.” The boy said. I looked at Saturn and Glaze then walked out of the closet. 
	“Um can we stay here after the storm passes?” I ask looking up to meet his eye level. 
	“Uhhhh… Sure I guess,” He said awkwardly.
	“Thank you umm sir?” Saturn thanked him.
	“Just call me Blaze.” Blaze said to us. “Okay so, I will let you guys stay here until the storm passes alright?” Blaze said looking at me and everyone else. 
	“I have a question,” Lulu said to Blaze.
	“Yes?” 
	“Can we explore, and maybe choose our own rooms?” Lulu asked. 
	“Uhhhhh…” Blaze turned then thought for a moment. I sighed then sat down on a small coffee table. 
	“Fine.” Blaze said turning back around. I jumped up and started to look around. I peeked my head in every single corner I could find. I ran room to room looking at every inch. 
	“Woah!” I said to myself as I walked into the perfect room. The walls were painted blue with clouds, the bed was a twin size bed, and last of all, an antique closet. I ran back to where everyone was. 
	“I found what room I want!” I said loudly.
	“Uh… that fast?” Blaze asked me.
	“Yep!” I responded cheerfully.
	“Okay let&#39;s go see it then.” Lulu said letting me lead the way to the room. When we got to the room, I happily placed my soaked backpack down on the carpet. 
	“This one?” Blaze asked looking at me.
	“Yeah!” I responded.
	“Alright then.” Blaze said walking out of the room. I took off my shoes and hopped onto the bed. I looked up at the ceiling. I looked at one blade on the fan on the ceiling and tried not to lose track. I slowly got border every second. I wonder what the others chose for their rooms. I got off the bed and walked out of the room. I walked around the hallways trying to look for the others or at least one. I walked around a room down a hallway. I walked towards it carefully just in case there was some weird evil monster. I opened it slowly. The room had dark purple walls, it was night themed. 
	“Wow!” I exclaimed. I saw Lulu sitting there peacefully reading. There were two dark grey chairs with some poofy white pillows on them, then there was a queen sized bed with lighter purple sheets. 
	“Oh hi Angel.” Lulu said to me as I walked in.
	“Nice room!” I said nicely.
	“Thanks.” She responded.
	“Hey do you want to come with me to explore everyone else’s rooms?” I ask.
	“Sure, why not?” She said closing her book. We walked down the hall looking for any signs of the other rooms. I spotted white door that had weird markings on it.. 
	“Hey look!” I said pointing at the door. 
	“Pfft, I think that Glaze most likely choose that room.” Lulu said. We walked towards it. I put my hand on the door gnome then turned it. I expected to see Glaze in there but instead it was Saturn. The walls were just yellow, with very few pieces of furniture. Saturn was sitting on the bottom of a bunk bed staring at the ground. 
	“Hi Saturn” Lulu said. Saturn looked up then waved.
	“Where do you think Glaze’s room is?” I asked Lulu.
	“Hm… maybe over there?” Lulu said pointing to a door next to mine.
	“Lets look!” I said excitedly. We walked over to the door. Lulu opened the door slowly. Inside was White walls with black tree like patterns. I spotted Glaze staring out the window. 	
	“Hey Glaze!” I cheered loudly.
	“Hey” He responded still looking outside. 
	“So what now?” Lulu asked.
	“I don’t know.” I responded.
	“Maybe we could like uh…” Lulu thought for a moment.
	“I know! We could go outside maybe” I suggested.
	“No!” Glaze and Lulu said at the same time.
	“Well… can I at least go outside?” I ask.
	“Fine, just be careful.” Lulu responded.
	“Yay!” I ran out of there, going to my room then getting on my shoes. I look outside. It&#39;s just some rain. I thought as I rushed down stairs and opened the door. I ran outside in the rain happily looking around. I walked around the house slowly, looking at some garden gnomes and trees. The rain started to come down a bit harder but I didn’t really mind. The wind started to make the trees shake a lot. I started to get a bit scared. Your fine Angel, nothings going to happen. I thought to myself. The wind got stronger almost making me slip. I looked around quickly, thinking of what to do. The storm got stronger. I ran over to the back door. I tried to open it but the pressure of the wind kept it shut. 
	“Help!” I yelled.
	“HELP!” I screamed louder. I kept on screaming. The wind blows through my hair. I stood there cold screaming for help. I felt a tear roll down my face. I started to cry. 
	“HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!” I scream louder and louder through a stream of tears. I ran off the porch then tried to seek out shelter. I’m going to die out here! I thought as I looked for a cave or something like that. I found a small cave that I could probably fit in. I squeezed through the small entrance. I cried at I looked back outside to the storm getting worse and worse. 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
   Chapter 6 (Saturn’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I looked sightlessly at the ground for a while trying to think of what to do. I closed my eyes for a bit. I got another vision into the future. It was the storm raging even more than before. Someone was there, she was screaming she needed help. It was terrifying. The vision stopped. Wait that was Angel! I jumped up and ran. I first ran into my wall, I sighed then stepped aside and walked out of my room. I ran to the other rooms wherever they were. 
	“Glaze! Lulu!” I yell for my friends. 
	“What?” Lulu said. I turned around to face Lulu if she was there.
	“Angel needs help now!” I yell.
	“What?!” Glaze said loudly. 
	“Angel needs help! She’s out in the storm!” I say loudly.
	“We need to help her!” Lulu said worryingly.
	“Grab your stuff!” I commanded. I ran back to my room trying to look for my backpack. I tripped over something. Found it I thought as I grabbed my backpack and ran out the door. 
	“Lets go!” Lulu said loudly. We ran down the stairs quickly. I tried to open the door trying to get out. The door barely moved. 
	“Guys help me!” I yell at them. They pushed their weight against the door in an attempt to open it. We fell through as the door opened up. We scrambled out of the house. The door shut due to the wind pressure. 
	“Come on!” I yell over the wind my voice slowly getting tired. I lead the way to where I saw Angel go. I felt around for a boulders and trees. I felt the right boulder that Angel ran past. I ran past the boulder quickly stopping. I put my hand forward to feel some sort of stone.
	“Who’s there?” I heard Angel speaking. Glaze and Lulu ran up behind me.
	“We’re here it’s okay.” Glaze said.
	“Oh okay come through the entrance.” Angel said. I climbed through the entrance being careful of any sharp rocks or anything else. I heard Lulu climb though.
	“Ack! I’m stuck!” I heard Glaze huff. Lulu laughed.
	“Wow! I&#39;m not surprised the tallest one here and the one who weighs the most got stuck!” Lulu continued laughing. Angel started to laugh as well. I tried to prevent myself from laughing, I let out a little giggle then started to crack up laughing.
	“Hey! Stop laughing at me and help me out here!” Glaze yelled. I grabbed onto his arm and tried to pull him through the entrance into the cave. Lulu and Angel helped as well. We managed to get him through. 
	“Thanks.” Glaze said.
	“No problem!” Angel said happily. I crawled to where I heard the rain. Hopefully… we will be okay.




&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
   Chapter 7 (Lulu’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I read my book peacefully, I flipped through the pages as the rain poured down. 	
	“Ugh!!! It’s so boring here!” Angel said loudly. 
	“Yeah maybe we should do something.” Glaze responded.
	“Like what?” I ask looking up from my book. 
	“Ummmm” I glared at Glaze as he tried to think.
	“Maybe you should stay quiet and let me read” I snapped at him. I looked back down at my book trying to start reading again. 
	“Sooooooooooo….” I heard Glaze start speaking. I look up a bit annoyed.
	“Can we do something?” Angel asked.
	“Yeah, can we?” Glaze looked at me.
	“Like what?” I said looking back.
	“Play uno again!” Angel said excitedly. I sigh.
	“Saturn do you want to play uno?” I ask looking at Saturn.
	“Nah… I&#39;m good.” Saturn responded. I reached into my back to grab my spell book. I picked up the ancient book and open it. I flipped through the pages to get to the right page. I placed my finger over the old writing. I chanted the spell in my mind. The cards appeared right beside me. I closed the book slightly again trying not to accidentally break the previous spells inside. I placed the book in my bag and grabbed the cards then shuffled them. I handed seven cards to me, Angel, and Glaze. The game once again went on for a while, I’d say probably an hour and twenty-three minutes, exactly. 
	“Uno!” Glaze called out. I placed a wild card down changing to the color yellow. Angel placed down her card.
	“What?!” Glaze said angered. 
	“Uno” I said calmly. Angel placed down a card. I placed down the same card as her.
	“I win.” I say a bit smugly.
	“Aw come on!” Glaze yelled. The cave shook a bit, then a piece of the cave fell off. 
	“Oops.” Glaze said awkwardly. More parts of the cave started to fall. 	
	“We need to get out of here now!” I said loudly.
	





&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 8 (Angel’s point of view)\
&lt;/div&gt;
	I panicked. Oh my goodness I’m going to die! I thought as I looked at Lulu.
	“Get through the entrance!” She said loudly. Glaze squeezed through the entrance managing not to get stuck this time. Saturn got through, then Lulu. I took a deep breath then ducked down. The cave completely collapsed. Panic went all through my body. I moved trying to avoid falling rocks. 
	“Angel!”I heard Lulu screamed. Wait I’m alive? I thought a bit scared. I put my hand on the rock moving the rock a bit slightly. I put both my hands of it lifting it off of me using all my strength. 
	“Ack!” I got up a bit slowly. My arms and legs felt pain. 
	“What the-” I heard Glaze says. “How are you alive?!” He asked shocked.
	“Oh yeahhh!” I remembered something. “I only die if my halo breaks completely.” I said trying to help them understand.
	“Okay then…” Glaze said looking a bit weirded out.
	“Hey it stopped raining!” Saturn said happily.
	“Yay!” I cheered out.
	“We could try and find better shelter now.” Lulu said looking exhausted. 
	“Yeah!” Glaze said happily.
	“Okay let&#39;s go!” I said getting up. 
	We all walked together in seek of shelter. It was a very strange day. I looked at my companions that I considered friends and smiled. I looked back then sighed. I know it’s going to be a long journey to find somewhere to stay but I believe that we will find that somewhere, together.

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 1 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	The ear-splitting bell rings throughout the classroom as kids rush out, excited for the weekend. I stay and linger, wanting to avoid a certain person.
	“Lunar!”
	Ugh.
	Robin rushes up to me. He’s my sworn enemy and I really, really hate him. He’s the kind of kid who everyone has a crush on, and he does track and stuff. I’m not athletic at all unless you count binge-watching reality TV as a sport.
	“Lunar, are you doing anything after school?” Robin chirps at me as I look like I’m busy shuffling papers. In the corner of my eye, I see Catherine glaring at me from the doorway. It’s no secret she has a HUGE crush on Robin, and she’s one of the popular girls.
	Probably why they all hate me anyway.
	“No,” I sigh at him. No escaping this annoying six-foot mess of bright-orange hair and freckles.
	“Oh, yay!” He exclaims, shoving his hand in his pocket. He obviously wants me to hang out with him. He’s already asked twice this week.
	“Oh, actually, I have a lot of homework,” I say quickly, changing my mind at the last second. I shrug my backpack onto my shoulders.
	“But... It’s Friday?” He stutters, obviously confused.
	“Um, I have... Other homework... Extra credit,” I say quickly. Man, this kid is annoying, I just want to go home.
	“Awh, well, see you tomorrow Lunar.” He sighs, defeated again. 
	“Tomorrow is Saturday.”
	“Oh. See you on Monday?”
	“See you.”
	This kid.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 2 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	Why won’t she hang out with me? I’m being nice and stuff. Every time I ask, she just uses another excuse.
	“I have gymnastics.”
	She doesn’t do sports.
	“I have too much homework.”
	It’s Friday.
	“I.. I don’t want to.”
	Well that hurts.
	I guess there isn’t really much I can do. Girls are weird, I guess. Real complicated. My friend Carson tried to date some girl (I think her name was Kate or Katie or something) back in freshman year. She punched him in the face. I mean, Kate (or was it Katie..?) was always kind of strange. Carson kind of had it coming. 
Anyway, the point is Lunar. I really don’t understand why she won’t hang out with me. We’ve known each other since elementary,  
And she’s always been nice to me. 
	I guess I’ll just keep asking.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 3 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	I trudge home, walking slowly. There’s nothing much there for me anyway. Just my cat, Riceball, and a bunch of instant ramen, which, surprisingly, does get old after a while.		I finally get home, and I open the door. It’s creaky and gets stuck all the time. It hasn’t been oiled in forever, and it took some convincing to get it open.
	When I’m finally inside, I go check on Riceball. I make sure her food, litter, and water are okay. 
	Once I make sure she’s fine, I make some food. Instant ramen again. I go to heat up some water when I hear it.
	A wild storm, uncontrollable and furious. At first, I’m not worried. We get storms like this all the time in Florida. I peek outside. Dark clouds and a lot of wind. I hurry over to the radio and switch it on.
	“Strong weather tonight. 79 degrees. Be careful! You should have your house boarded and lots of candles available. Hurricane Lilith is about to hit.”
	&#39;&#39;HURRICANE?!&#39;&#39;


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 4 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	I stand at the bus stop for twenty minutes, waiting. Dark clouds are above me and the wind is fierce. I sigh and glance at the bus sign.
	Bus relocated.
	Go figure.
	I have to walk home, and it takes a while. I live twenty minutes away in a car, so it takes about an hour to walk home. My phone is dead, so I can’t call my mom. On the way, I always pass by this old, shabby neighborhood that’s said to be abandoned. I glance up when I pass through it and the clouds are black. Uh, okay, bad sign. The wind whips my hair around and I realize something.
	There’s going to be another hurricane. 
	Okay. Okay, this is not good. Forty minutes from home, in an abandoned neighborhood, no phone, and in a hurricane.
	Just my luck.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 5 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	I swallow hard. I don’t have anything to protect myself with, and I don’t have any extra food or electricity. I rushed down to the basement to make sure Riceball is okay. I pick her up and set her down in the storage room, along with her food, litter, and water. I figured this is the safest place for her.
	Just then, there was a knock at the door. Seriously? I don’t need solicitors trying to sell me bread in the middle of a hurricane. By this point, my patience is out. I storm up to the door and throw it open, and the wind screams from outside.
	“Um, uh, hi I’m kind of sort of very far from home and I’m kind of scared so um can I stay with you for a while until the hurricane passes please I&#39;m sorry to bother you I won’t do this again it’s just I don’t know where to go thank you please,”
	A voice stutters from outside. I wipe my hair out of my face and try to get a good look.
From the glance I get, it’s unmistakable. The ruffled, bright orange hair and the abundance of freckles. 
“Robin?”


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 6 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	“Lunar?” 
	Okay, this is weird. Suddenly, it all comes together. Why she always said that she couldn’t hang out. Why she never wanted to talk to me.
	Probably because I’m really annoying, but maybe cause she lived alone in the middle of a shabby abandoned neighborhood. 
	Not sure.
	Anyway, I just asked to take refuge in the middle of a hurricane &#39;&#39;in her house.&#39;&#39;
	Yeah, I can see why she hates me.
	Lunar glares at me for a second, them mumbles:
	“Get in,”
	Grateful, I trudge inside and glance around. I’m in awe at the sheer amount of dust and broken furniture. It’s weird, realizing that she lived like this.
	Makes the ‘gymnastics’ excuse seem even more hurtful, to be honest.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 7 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	Fantastic. Now I have an annoying, orange-haired bozo stuck in my house with me in the middle of a hurricane.
	Can this day get any worse?
	Seriously. The one person I’ve gone through so much to avoid is now stuck with me for twelve to twenty-four hours (I heard that on the radio about hurricanes). 
	I don’t have much time to dwell on it, though. A surge of wind slams into the wall, making a horrible creaking sound.
	I grab the rest of the water I had saved and bring it to the basement. For once, Robin stays quiet. I check on Riceball one more time to make sure she’s okay and then go back upstairs.
	“Come on. We’ll be safer in the basement,” I mutter to Robin and gesture downstairs.
	“Are you sure? What if the ceiling crumbles?” He asks quietly. He’s obviously afraid of going downstairs.
	“Oh, come on,” I growl. “It’s just a basement.”
	“Fine..” He stutters, following me down.
	Sure, my basement isn’t pretty. The original owners of the house never finished it, so it’s full of mice and creaky floorboards. 
	I lead Robin down to the storage room. I slowly open the door and tell him to get inside.
	“Are you sure about this, Lunar?” He stutters. 
	“Oh come on. Stop complaining, you asked to come in,”
	“Fine,” he huffs, then crawls in. Like the rest of the basement, the storage room is dark, full of mice, and unfinished.
	We sit for a while and try to wait out the hurricane.
	Suddenly, I hear something moving. There’s a rustling sound, then Robin squeals.
	“Something just ran over my foot!” he shrieks.
	Just then, perfectly on cue, Riceball meows.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 8  - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	We sat in Lunar’s storage room for what felt like hours. She didn’t talk after her cat ran over my foot, so I didn’t either. My mom was probably panicking, wondering what was happening and where I was.
	The wind outside howled, and the ceiling of the storage room quaked. I heard Lunar exhale gently beside me.
	This is not a good situation. I had to fight myself not to run, not to scream. I could feel myself panicking, my head pounding and my heart racing.
What if we don’t make it out alive? What if the ceiling falls on top of us? What if we run out of supplies? What if-
	“Robin, you&#39;re going to be fine. Stop panicking.”


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 9 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	Lesson learned - Robin’s scared of everything. It’s actually really annoying, the way I can just sense him panicking beside me. It is interesting, though, to see that such a popular, confident person like him gets scared like this.
	The storage room was dark, with a dull electric lightbulb hanging from the ceiling. It gave off just barely enough light to see, but not enough to see very well, which was why Robin panicked so much when my cat ran over his foot.
	The hurricane was still raging outside. The tiny lightbulb swung back and forth gently. The only sound you could hear was the shrill whistling of the hurricane and the quiet sound of Robin breathing and Riceball softly sleeping.
The gentle sounds around me slowly lulled me into a soft sleep.
	This is honestly a strange thing since Robin smelled gross and there was a hurricane outside, but whatever. It sounded cool, okay?
	Anyway, I woke up eventually to Robin violently shaking my shoulder.
	“What do you WANT?” I huffed, rubbing my eyes and sitting up.
	“Oh, phew. I thought you were in a coma or died or something,” Robin muttered.
	I stared at him for a minute.
	“Uh, anyway, there’s something you need to see. I think we have a bit of a problem,” he stammered, gesturing to the back corner of the storage room.
	I crawled over. The floor was damp, and I narrowly avoided getting a splinter. I checked the wall, and it looked fine to me.
	“No, look up,” Robin muttered from the other corner of the room.
	So I did. And boy, I have never wanted to punch him in the face as much as I did right then.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 10 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
“Excuse ME, genius, but how was I supposed to know that the bottle would hit the ceiling?” I grumbled, glaring at Lunar.
“Okay, sorry you massive grump. Just because you were flipping water bottles and somehow managed to make a hole in the roof, doesn’t mean that you had to wake me up,” she spat at me, still trying to duct tape the water-bottle sized hole in the ceiling.
I know, I know. It sounds really stupid, but I got bored. There really wasn’t much else to do.
Lunar is obviously not happy with me. It seems like everything is my fault. I stare at the floor. I feel like a guilty child when they knock over a vase or something.
This is not the best day.
My mind starts to drift to other things. Like why wasn’t school closed today? They knew there was a hurricane, right?
Also, why did they have to relocate the bus? Then I would be at home with my mom and my dog, and not stuck in some girl’s storage room in an abandoned neighborhood. 
I check my phone. Still dead. There isn’t anything I can do. I’m starting to feel panicky again. My throat starts to close up and I get a pit in my stomach. What if Lunar decides that I’m just a bother and kicks me out?
I go over that idea in my head. It’s unrealistic. There’s a hurricane. She wouldn’t do that. 
Would she?


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 11 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	Robin is panicking again. I can just tell. I wrap a last layer of tape around the hole and stare at him.
	“Robin.”
	He doesn’t answer. I say it louder, more forcefully.
	“Robin.”
	He’s still not answering. I go over to him. He’s staring at nothing.
	“ROBIN!”
	He jumps. He looks at me for a second and turns red.
	“Why weren’t you answering me?” I say crossly. He’s really gotten on my nerves now.
	“Sorry… I kind of just spaced out,” he stutters, embarrassed.
	“Okay, sure, whatever. Just don’t do it again. You scared me,” I sighed, turning away.
	Robin was about to say something, but the hurricane had other plans.
	A massive crash went off above us. The floor and the ceiling trembled. I looked up. A small chunk of wood fell on my face.
	The ceiling was crumbling.
	I grabbed Riceball as fast as I could. I yelled at Robin to run. He rammed into the door and flung it open. We both rushed out and dashed up the stairs. A part of the roof had collapsed into the upstairs staircase, and at least five centimeters of water was flooding the main room. Rain and wind lashed violently, forcing our breath away.
	In the chaos, Riceball squirmed and thrashed in my arms. Her sharp claws dug into my skin, making me yelp. I let her go, and she bolted.
	That was the biggest mistake of my entire life.
	I heard her yowling through the storm. A huge pit in my stomach formed. My breath was shaky and tears were starting to appear in my eyes.
	“RICEBALL!” I howled, barely hearing her desperate meowing as she fought the storm.
	Somewhere, in the back of my head, I knew something. I just wasn’t ready to accept it.
	Riceball would never make it out there. She belonged to the storm now.
		The tears in my eyes overflowed. My whole body was shaking. I couldn’t hear Riceball anymore. My heart ached and I couldn’t think straight.
	Robin was still standing beside me, covering his head with his soaking backpack and fighting off wind. I started to run towards the road. I had to find Riceball.
	Robin stopped me. He grabbed me shoulder and held me back. I didn’t fight. I knew that it would be stupid, to run to find something that I knew I could never have back.
	I sighed heavily through my tears. A hurricane only lasts twelve to twenty-four hours, right? It had already been maybe four or five. Maybe, just maybe, after the storm passed…
	“Lunar, she’s not coming back,” Robin said gently to me (which wasn’t very gently because you couldn’t really hear anything over the storm, so he was kind of yelling).
	And somewhere, somehow, I knew that. And I had to accept it, whether I liked it or not.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 12 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	I’ve lost a few pets before. But the thing people never talk about is watching someone lose a pet.
	It almost hurts as much as losing your own pet. Like you can kind of feel how they feel, you can see their grief and sorrow and that kind of thing. 
	Watching Lunar lose her cat, I didn’t really know what to do. I mean, what are you supposed to do? Say ‘sorry for your loss’ and then leave? It’s not like I could do either of those things.
	I had to stop Lunar from chasing after her cat, right? I mean, it’s not like I could let her go chasing after Riceball into a hurricane alone. I still feel bad about it, though. Like I did something wrong but I also knew it was right.
	Anyway, I think the more pressing matter is that Lunar and I were standing in a hurricane.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 13 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	Robin and I didn’t stand there for long. We had to find new shelter, clean water, and food fast, and the water at our feet was rising.
	I asked Robin if he had any ideas.
	“Well,” He said, still using his backpack to cover his head (he was soaking anyway). “We could go to my house. We’re only about ten minutes away. If we go now, we can get there before the water is too high.”
	“Okay,” I muttered. I guess we were going to Robin’s house.
	The only problem was how to get there. We didn’t have a raft or anything, and the last thing we wanted to do was walk ten minutes in ankle-deep water (which might actually be knee-deep by the time we get there).
	We had to walk.
	It was probably not the proudest ten minutes of my life. Robin complained every two minutes and I was getting fed up. We were soaked, tired, and we still had about ten or more hours of this stupid hurricane. 
	I was fed up and exhausted. I didn’t want to keep going, even if Robin’s house was only two minutes away. I lost my cat. I lost my house.
	Why do these kinds of things always happen?
	I was going to give up. By this point, all I felt like doing was digging a very deep hole and then staying there forever.
	But nope, life decided to throw me in a hurricane with my mortal enemy.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 14 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	The water is almost up to our knees now. Lunar is not happy (I can tell by the way she’s stomping and making huge splashes) and I’m soaked to the bone. 
	Finally, finally, I see my house. The windows are boarded and the water is just barely at the bottom of the door. Our house is on stilts, because there’s been a lot of floods but this is probably the biggest one.
	The water has risen to my knees now. For Lunar, it’s up to her thighs. She’s glaring at me, but I’m too tired to care. Too much happened today. I don’t care what some girl thinks of me anyway.
	I trudge up to the door. I know there’s no way anybody would answer, but I tried anyway.
	I heard the faint noise of the doorbell ding inside. I stand there for a minute, and nobody answers.
	Big shocker, right?
	Anyway, we have to get inside somehow. I contemplated breaking down the door, but that would just be inconvenient and my mom probably would not be happy with me. 
	I checked around the house for more ways to get in. All the windows were boarded, even the ones on the second floor. There was no way to get in.
	Breaking down the door it is.
	I back up as far as I can go without the water being too deep. I almost backed out more times than I can count, but I kept convincing myself that this was the only way to get in.
	It did not help that Lunar was glaring at me VERY fiercely at this point, but she didn’t bother asking what I was doing.
	I charged forward. Just as my body was about to hit the door, at the WORST time possible, my mom opens the door.
	You can probably imagine what happened. I hit her at full force. She stumbled backwards, and we landed on top of eachother.
	“ROBIN!” She growled. 
	Oh no.
	Yeah, it didn’t end too well.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 15 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	I don’t know what made Robin think this was a good idea.
	Anyway, more important matter, we could go inside. I helped Robin’s mom up, closed the door, and left her to scold her son.
	He totally deserved it.
	I walked around their house for a while. It was a nice place, but it would have been nicer if everything wasn’t boarded up.
	Oh yeah, the hurricane.
	I spotted something in the corner of the living room. I walked over, curious to see what it was.
	It was a white, fluffy, Japanese Spitz. It’s a dog breed that originated in Japan. I’ve always liked cats more, but I’ve heard about this kind of dog in books and stuff.
	Anyway, the more pressing matter was that IT WAS ADORABLE. It’s fur was so thick that I could stick my hand in it and I could barely see it. I pet it for a while, but I didn’t last long because there was an aching pain in my stomach.
	Riceball.
	I missed her so much. She was the best cat in the world. She would shed everywhere and knock cups off the counter, but all of that didn’t matter. I just wanted her back.
	Robin’s mom must have been done scolding him, because I heard Robin walking towards me (at this point, I could just kind of tell his footsteps).
	“Hey, are you okay?” He muttered quietly. I must have been visibly upset.
	“Yeah, I’m just thinking about my cat,” I sighed solemnly. “I miss her.”
	“Yeah, I can understand that. Here, if it makes you feel any better, I can tell you a story,” He shrugged.
	“Fine, go for it,” I muttered. I really wasn’t in the mood.
	“Okay, I will. When I was four, I used to have this pet goldfish. I named her Goldie,”
	“How original,” I grumbled.
	“Hey, don’t be such a grump. I was four!”
	“Okay, fine, continue.”
	“Anyway, one day I was supposed to clean out her tank. My mom wasn’t home, and somehow my four year old self thought it would be a good idea to dump the water down the sink, refill it, and put Goldie back in,”
	“Okay, and what happened?”
	“So I didn’t realize that Goldie would come out of the tank with the water,” He said gently. “So I poured out the water down the drain. Along with Goldie,”
	“And what happened?” I muttered.
	“Never saw her again,” He chuckled.
	Honestly, the story wasn’t that funny. I don’t know why, maybe I was just so tired from everything that had happened, but I started to laugh.
	It wasn’t long before Robin started too. We were both so tired, wet, and after everything that had happened, I think we both needed to laugh.
	“Okay, you two can stop now,” Robin’s mom sighed from the kitchen. “You are really loud,”
	Oh yeah, I should probably introduce myself to Robin’s mom.
	I make my way to the kitchen and walk up to her.
	“Hi, I’m Lunar,” I mutter. I’m not in the best state. My clothes are dirty and I’m soaking.
	“I know; Robin’s told me all about you,” She chirps happily. “He’s asked every day if you could come over.” 
I whip my head around and give Robin a death stare.
	By now, it’s night. The sky is dark and finally, finally, the hurricane is starting to die down.
	His mom gives us some snacks and we talk for a while. I explain how I lost my cat, and Robin’s mom gives me a sympathetic  look.
	At some point, I must have fallen asleep, because I woke up on Robin’s sofa.
	I sit up groggily. Robin and his mom must have went upstairs to sleep, because there isn’t anybody else in the living room or kitchen. I let out a small yawn and rub my eyes. I peek out the window to check if the hurricane is still out there.
	Instead of dreary rain and wind, I’m greeted by the morning sun.
	The sun!
	The hurricane is over!
	I consider going to tell Robin, but I quickly shut down the idea. He’s probably still asleep, and I don’t really want to wake him.
	I hear footsteps coming down the staircase. I expect it to be Robin’s mom, but it’s not. It’s not Robin either. Instead, it’s a girl with long orange hair and a ruffled t-shirt. She’s wearing multicolored socks and purple glasses. She spots me, smiles, and bounds over.
	“Hi, I’m Violet!” She chirped happily.
	“Uh, Hi. I’m Lunar,” I mutter. This girl must be Robin’s sister. She looks just like him.
	“Violet, leave her alone,” Robin sighs from behind her. He must have come down the stairs right after her.
	“Oh, come on! Why can’t I hang out with your new girlfriend?” Violet huffed.
	“She’s not my girlfriend,” Robin growls at her, and gives me a ‘I’m so sorry’ look.
	“It’s fine,” I say quickly, wanting to do anything other than have this conversation.
	“Oh, so she is your girlfriend?” Violet squeaks.
	“No, Violet. That’s not what she meant and you know it.”
 Robin sighs.
	Robin’s mom comes down after a while and makes Robin, Violet, and I something to eat.
	“Anyway, Lunar,” Robin’s mom says sweetly as we’re eating. “You should really go home. I bet your parents are worried.” 
	I shift uncomfortably in my chair. How am I supposed to tell her that I don’t have any?
	“Uh,” Robin stutters, giving me a look that said ‘can I tell her?’. I think about it for a moment, then nod.
	“Lunar, uh, she doesn’t exactly have parents,” He stammered.
	“WHAT?” Robin’s mom yelped, a lot louder than I expected her to. She gave me a look of disbelief and I sank into the chair.
	I decide that I have to explain.
	“When I was four, I got adopted by these people,” I start. “I don’t remember much, but I do remember that they didn’t like me. We lived in the abandoned neighborhood.”
	“Yes, I think I know the place.” Robin’s mom says gently.
	“One day, there were going out for groceries, and I wanted to come. They repeatedly said I couldn’t, and left without me. They said they would be back in an hour or two, so I waited. I waited for three hours and they didn’t come back. That night, I put myself to bed, and I realized that they weren’t coming back. All they had left was my older sister’s clothes, some canned food, and the cat. I’ve lived alone ever since they left, and a grocery store worker has been kind enough to give me food for free. I ended up enrolling myself in school, and the principal understood that I didn’t have parents but couldn’t do anything about it. I guess that’s it.” I rambled. 
	Robin’s family stares at me in disbelief.
	“So, what are you going to do?” Robin muttered. “You’re house is destroyed,” 
	Robin’s mom lets out an even louder gasp.
	“DESTROYED?!” She says breathlessly. 
	“Oh, yeah, I thought I mentioned that last night when we were telling you about it,” Robin stuttered.
	Robin’s mom is really staring at me now. Her face is a mixture of disbelief, sympathy, and pure shock. 
	“Oh, honey, I didn’t know,” She muttered softly.
	I glared at Robin. I don’t know why, but it felt wrong to not glare at him. I sigh and turn back to his mom.
	“It’s fine, really. I’ll just find somewhere else to live,” I shrugged. It’s really NOT fine, but I really didn’t want everyone thinking that I was begging for attention or something like that.
	Which, I wasn’t. It was all completely true.
	Anyway, I just wanted to get out of this place and find somewhere else to be. It’s Saturday, so maybe Miku (the girl at the grocery store who gave me food, she’s really nice) wouldn’t mind having me over for a while.
	“You can stay with us for a while,” Robin’s mom blurts suddenly. “We have an extra room,” 


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 16 - Robin&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	“WHAT?!”
	I stare at my mom is disbelief. She’s going to let some girl who she barely knows stay with us for WHO KNOWS HOW LONG?!
	Lunar and I have the same expression. She doesn’t want to stay here and I don’t want her to, so win-win.
	Except for my mom.
	“Uh, I, uhm,” Lunar stammers. “I.. Have a friend I can stay with. It’s fine, really,”
	“No, I insist!” My mom states firmly.
	Lunar and I both glance at each other. We have to convince my mom that it’s really not okay and Lunar doesn’t want to stay with us.
	“Mom,” I begin. “Lunar really doesn’t want to stay here. And besides, with Violet and I, it’s too much work. It’s unrealistic,” 
	My mom sighs, like she knew all along that it would never work. She turns to Lunar.
	“Well, I suppose that’s okay,” she says. “Just get in contact with your friend and we’re here if you ever need us, okay?”
	Phew.


&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;Two days later…&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\

&lt;&lt;linkreplace &quot;&#39;&#39;Chapter 17 - Lunar&#39;&#39;&quot; t8n&gt;&gt;\
	“Hey, Lunar, food’s done!” Miku yells from downstairs. I rush down at the delicious scent of Miku’s cooking.
	It’s been two days since the hurricane ended and I left Robin’s. I’ve been living with Miku, my friend from the grocery store. School has been cancelled for the rest of the week, and I haven’t seen Robin since I left.
	Living with Miku hasn’t been that bad. She’s an excellent cook, and she has a cat named Bean that didn’t like before, but I think he’s starting to grow on me.
	Miku was only a few years older than me, but she felt like the mother I never had. She was kind and always thought about my feelings. She did have to work at the grocery store a lot, though, so I only really saw her in the mornings, at night, and when she came home early.
	But I didn’t have a problem with that. She was around enough.
	I finished the food Miku had made (beef and cheese tacos, by the way) and rushed upstairs. My favorite show was on in a few minutes.
	I was sitting on my bed when my phone buzzed. The screen lit up with a notification:
	“Robin, 5 new text messages.”
	Oh yeah, Robin has NOT stopped texting me since I left. Every two minutes he wants to talk to me.
	Which, surprisingly, I don’t have a problem with.
	 I pick up my phone to answer.

	“Hey, Ralph. Did you finish the project yet?” I growled into the radio.
	“Yeah. I did. Didn’t you see the results? They were better than expected.” Ralph’s voice crackled back through the radio.
	I glance outside. Yep. The damage is certainly noticeable. Houses are collapsed and trees are fallen. It’s been about a week since Ralph’s experiment. I press the button to reply to him.
	“Yeah, I saw. Did you manage to get the kids?” I sighed into the device.
	“I was worried you were going to ask that,” Ralph said. “No, I didn’t. The girl got out. I don’t know where she is.”
	“And the boy? The orange-haired one?” I hiss. “You atleast got the boy, right?”
	Ralph sighs from the other end.
	“No, they both got away. The girl’s place is completely destroyed, though.”
	I try to hold back my anger. Those kids could ruin everything. They have no idea how powerful they are.
	“Fine,” I snarl. “Get the kids. Do everything you can. We cannot let them get away.”
&lt;&lt;/linkreplace&gt;&gt;\

Once upon a time, there lived a little puppy. He lived in the humid rainforests of Florida, where he was abandoned as a baby. He lives inside of a hollow, fallen tree, where he chases bunnies, eats berries, barks at squirrels, and sleeps.
Then, on one sad, sad day, an extremely evil man moved into an abandoned, little wooden shack that is near the log that the puppy lives in.
The puppy could tell right away that this man was MEAN. He yelled at the poor puppy just for sitting in the very corner of the man’s yard, because he saw some berries over there, and he was eating them.

One day, after many hours of depression from the man, the puppy woke up and picked up a glorious scent. He looked up towards the awful man’s shack, and saw the man pushing a large wheelbarrow. He got a little bit closer, and saw that the wheelbarrow was overflowing with high-quality, expensive, and so-so delicious chicken nuggets!
When the man got inside of the shack, the puppy happily trotted up to the path that the man had pushed the wheelbarrow. He ate the few chicken nuggets that fell out and, unfortunately, got to close to the shack.
“GET OFF MY LAWN STUPID DOG!” The man shouted. The puppy whimpered and walked away. 

He was thinking that he DEFINITELY wanted some chicken nuggets, but the mean man was stashing them in the basement of his shack. He was wondering how he could POSSIBLY steal some for himself, when something caught his eye.
He spotted two small, brown, mice scurrying along the back of the man&#39;s shack.
They stopped moving near a vent on the wall, and seemed to argue. The larger one squeezed in between the metal bars on the vent, and then got stuck, because his butt couldn’t fit through.
The puppy could see the smaller mouse panicking, because he was trying to push the fat mouse. Then, he accidentally fell in to the vent.
He then poked his head up out through the vent from the inside, with a smile on his face. He pulled the fat mouse, who was still stuck, and then the fat mouse popped inside!
The puppy thought that this was suspicious, so he walked over to the vent. He could see them through the vent, on top of a shelf. He looked further down, struggling to see, and could make out the faint image of a wheelbarrow that was full of the chicken nuggets!

	He calmly barked at the mice, and they looked up at him, and they immediately hid.
	“I won’t hurt you,” He said. They didn’t reply. “What are you guys doing down in there?”
	“Don’t eat us…”
	“I won’t eat you.” The puppy replied. “Are you getting some chicken nuggets?”
	“Yeah. We don’t really have much to eat, so we thought that maybe we could sneak some.”
	“Wow, he’s never caught you?”
	“No.”
	“Could you possibly get me some, please?”
	“Only if you promise not to hurt us.” The fat mouse appeared. 
	“I would never hurt you. I promise.” The puppy assured them.
	“Fine, we’ll get you some.”
	The mice went into the vent, while the puppy waited. About five minutes later, the mice had made a pile of about 10 chicken nuggets on the ground. They each took turns taking them up to the vent, and eventually, they got them all up. 
	The puppy got half, and the mice go the rest.
	This continued for many weeks, and the man kept bringing more about every other month. They all lived happy lives, and they became great friends. The puppy let the mice move into his log, an they lived happily ever after!

	I stare at the clock. 5 ,4 ,3 ,2 ,1, finally! I can get out of detention and go home. I walk outside and unlock my bike. It takes me about 20 minutes to get home and I’m halfway there when I see a white streak of light fly by me. I stop, my brakes screeching.
	“ What the heck was that?” I wonder aloud. I try not to think about it too much the rest of the way home. as I approach my front door, I hear a crazed barking and know it could only be one thing“ Echo!” I yell shoving my face into her fur “ I missed you too!” I say as she licks my face lick crazy. I know no one is home so I run into the backyard and play with echo “ Come on!” I say to Echo as I go up the steps of my tree house. The only reason we got steps was so that echo could go up there with me “ Echo. I know you might not be able to understand me, but on the way home, I saw a light flash by me and I know it wasn’t a person. What do you think it was?” Echo just barks then she tries to shrug. At least that’s how it looked. 
“ Even though you might not know what I’m saying, it’s comforting when I talk to you. I don’t know what I’d do without you.” I say “ What’s that?” I say walking toward the treehouse window. I see a hole with a box in it. I walk out of the treehouse and inspect the hole. The box inside is small with the weirdest keyhole I’ve ever seen. echo barks and scares me half to deaf. I turn around and see that there’s a key underneath her. I grab it and try to fit it into the keyhole on the box. It fits! I slowly turn the key then BOOM! a weird portal comes out. Echo barks at it then leaps in “ ECHO!!!!” I jump in after her and then the next thing I know, I’m somewhere else. Somewhere beautiful 
“ Where are we?” I ask.
“ A flying wolf realm?” I stare at Echo in shock.
“ I can understand you! Oh, I’m a wolf. I’M A WOLF?!” I scream.
“ Eve, calm down. It’s okay.” Echo says.
“ Your voice. It’s so beautiful.” Echo blushes.
“ Thanks.” Echo responds “ We should see if there’s a cave where we could spend the night-” What the? 
“ ECHO!” I yell at the top of my lungs as a dark figure drags me away.
“ Eve?” Echo whips around “ EVE!”

    Kidnapped\
&lt;/div&gt;
	“ What do you want?” I say panting.
	“ For you to die.” says a deep and horrific voice. I stay there in shock.
	“ Why? What did I do? Nevermind that! Who are you?!” I questioned.
“ Some people call me Bramble, but others call me psycho.” He smirks “ I need you gone for reasons you’ll find out when you’re dead!” He darts towards me. I step out of the way and he slams into the pole that keeps me from getting out.
“ Good job. You forgot to open the door.” I say trying my best not to laugh.
“ Brat. You think I don’t know that.” He says like a smart aleck 
“ Yes, yes I do. Anyways I don’t know what you want but Echo will find me and rescue me. I know it.” I say in a confident voice.
“ Oh yeah? BOYS! We have a wolf to go after. Someone by the name of Echo.” Bramble says, his eyes like knives glaring into mine.
“ No. NO! PLEASE DON’T HURT HER! I’ll do anything, anything! Just please, don’t hurt her.” Bramble smirks.
“ That’s what I thought.” He looks behind my back “ What’s that?” 
I sweat “ Nothing. It’s nothing.” I lie holding the key behind my back.
“ I said ‘ What’s that?’!” He roars “ Don’t lie to me! What is that?!” 
“ My escape out of here. See Ya!” I put the key in the lock of the box and think echo. a portal appears then I back into it “ See ya later, Bramble.”
“ THIS WON’T BE THe LAST YOU HEAR OF MA! YA HEAR THAT?!” Bramble roars. 
“ Ouch.” I land right on soft sand and know I’m still in the wolf realm “ Oh no, echo’s not here! Uhg, just my luck.” I sigh and lay on my stomach. Out of the corner of my eye, I see a  pond. I feel how dry my throat is and I decide to drink out of the pond. as I walk over a see a reflection of a wolf with white fur surrounding their eyes like skiing goggles and the rest of the fur was black. Oh wait! That’s me! I gaze into the pond admiring myself. Five minutes later I remember what Bramble said “ OH NO! He’s going after Echo! What do I do?” I pace back and forth and back and forth. Then I stop and warm tears flow down my face “ Wherever you are echo, I hope you’re okay.” I wipe the now cold tears off my face and start wandering around How does Bramble know me? What does he want with me? What did I do?! I think to myself.
“ Um, excuse me? are you lost?” I turn around and see a wolf with pink spots. 
“ Kind of. I’m looking for a wolf by the name of echo. Have you seen her?” The wolf shakes their head. I sigh “ Um, this is a random question but,-” I pause for a second to hold back the fear “- do you know who Bramble is?” She gasps.
“ Dad.” I hear her mutter.
“ DAD?! Bro, no offence but your dad’s a psycho!” I say find of regretting what I said.
She sighs “ He killed our family. and now, he’s after a girl by the name of Eve.” The wolf says.
“ Heh, here’s the thing. My name’s Eve and he already tried to kill me, like five minutes ago. also he’s after my do- I mean friend, Echo.” I say as the wind blows the fur out of my eyes exposing my ocean blue eyes.
“ It is you. You can save my family! Please help me get my dad back!” her eyes like a puppies when it wants food.
“ Okay. But first, we need to find Echo. Deal?” I reach out my paw.
“ Deal.” She puts out her paw but I think of something.
“ Wait.” I pull away my paw “ No tricks?” She nods and we shake paws “ By the way, what’s your name?” I ask
“ Asteroid. My name is Asteroid.” I smile and she smiles back

    Discovering my Destiny\
&lt;/div&gt;
	“ So what do we do first?” Asteroid asks.
	“ We, um.” I think “ I think we should find the cave that Bramble was in and see if Echo’s there.” 
	“ Well, how did you get out?” She wonders out loud.
	I stare at the soft sand in shock “ The key.” I mutter. 
	“ Key? What key?” My eyes widen.
	“ Um, well.” I sigh “ This key.” I hold out the key in front of her. She gasps.
	“ You’re the guardian?” she asks. I tilt my head wondering what she meant.
	“ Guardian? What do you mean?” I ask frantically.
	“ Don’t worry. It’s not a bad thing.” she sighs “ You really don’t know, do you?” I shake my head “ Well get ready for the prophecy of your life. Fourteen years ago, a child was born. A child by the name of Eve.” 
	I gasp “ Me?” She nods
	“ The day you were born, the three gods of the realms decided for that child to be a guardian. a guardian of a key. a key of realms. There are five keys. The key of destruction, the key of music, the key of dreams, the key of gems, and the most powerful key of them all. The key of realms. and you are the one who guards it.” 
	“ Who guards the other keys?” I ask asteroid.
	She sighs “ They were unworthy and lost the keys. But now you’re here and we can save the keys!” She exclaims 
	“ We? What do you mean we?” I question
	“ You, me, and Echo.” She says
	“ But doesn’t you say I had to do it?” I start to wonder
	“ Uh yeah but there’s a tiny thing I forgot to mention. I’m one of those guardians, and I need your help.” My jaw drops.
	“ Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?!” Asteroid shrugs.
	“ I thought you be too overwhelmed with all the info I just gave you.” she says
	“ I’m not.” She stares at me in shock.
	“ Really?”
	“ Really.” 
	“ How come?” She asks.
	“ I’ve had dreams of people screaming. Just last night three large beings talked to me about this prophecy. They said that echo was an important part of it. I just passed it off as a weird dream” 
	“ Wow. You talked to the gods of the realms. Do you know how important that is?!” I shrug.
	“ I guess it’s cool. I don&#39;t know.” I say “ That doesn’t matter right now. We need to find Echo!”
	“ But how? Who knows what Bramble could have already done to her!” Asteroid exclaims.
	“ We don’t know if Bramble has gotten to her yet. and um, I think you forgot that I have the key of realms.” I say sarcastically
“ That takes you to different realms . Not caves.” she says.
“ I got out of the cave with it and ended up here. Not a different realm. We have to at least try.” Asteroid hesitates then nods “ Okay, here we go. I grab the key and the box. I think Bramble’s cave and then unlock the box. A portal appears right away “ You ready?” Asteroid nods and we hop in getting ready for the fight of our lives.

&lt;/div&gt;
	“ We’re here.” I say peeking into the cave.
	“ Wow, that worked?” I raise my eyebrow like a smart aleck.
	“ I see echo. They did get her.” I whisper to asteroid “ I don’t see Bramble. asteroid? DUDE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” I whisper shout as I see her walking toward Echo.
	“ Working for me of course.” say a familiar voice.
“ GIVE ME BACK ECHO!” I growl.
“ She’s not really there. You’re dreaming you idiot.” I blink.
“ I’m so stupid. So you’re not real? There’s no keys?” Bramble laughs.
“ No, no. I’m real and so are the- wait! How did you know about the keys?” I shrug
“ I had a dream. Like this one. What didn’t I dream?” I see Bramble smirk.
“ Me kidnapping you.” he says.
“ So, I didn’t escape.” I scratch my head.
“ You did but before you could, I made you fall asleep.” I think for a second.
“ How? Black magic?” I chuckle.
“ Um, yeah. What else?” he says.
“ Ok, but is Echo really there?” He nods slowly “ How did you find her?! Nevermind that, do you know where I am?” He smirks.
“ Yes, we do. I’m sending my group to find your body, bring it to me, so I can kill you and this stupid prophecy doesn’t come true!” he laughs the most horrible laugh I’ve ever heard.
“ I’m getting out of here! But first, I have a question. I saw a white flash go by me yesterday, do you know what that was?” 
Bramble frowns “ It was a failed attempt to kill you.” 
“ Okay cool, ok bye.” I feel myself waking and then, I’m awake.
“ Ha Ha! I made it out… Oh um. What the?” I stare into Bramble’s deep hazel eyes “ aw poop. You lied, I didn’t make it out.” 
“ Yeah, ya didn’t.” he says.
“ And Echo isn’t here either is she?” he shakes his head “ Uhg, just kill me already.” 
“ Gladly.” he sprints toward my cave and rams into the bar. I burst out laughing.
“ Ha Ha! It’s almost too easy. Stop, please. I’M GONNA PEE! Also-” I step out through the bars “ - you should really make your bars closer together.” 
“ Wait, NO!” he roars.
“ Bye!” I fly out through the entrance.
“ GET HER!” I hear Bramble yell out. I see at least twenty wolves flying toward me.
“ Uh oh.” I say weirdly “ Really wish I had help right about now.”

&lt;/div&gt;
“ EVE!” screams a familiar voice. Then it hits me.
“ ECHO?! Is that you?” I turn my head and see Echo flying towards me. I go in her direction “ Echo! I’ve you!” 
“ Me too! Oh um. Who’s that?” She says pointing to the wolves flying behind me. 
“ Long story. Right now we need help!” I yell.
“ On it.” I see a wolf emerge from a cloud. Then more and more “ Wow, great job Echo!” She smiles.
“ Get them!” I hear Bramble yell.
“ Who’s that?” Echo asks.
“ The guy I need to fight. I love you Echo.” I fly away and stop in front of Bramble “ Goodbye Bramble.” I grab the key and think of a white infinite prison “ I’m sorry I could help you.” a portal opens underneath Bramble and he starts to fall.
“ THIS WON’T BE THE LAST OF ME! YA HEAR THAT?!” he screams as he falls into the abyss of white. The portal closes and I shiver.
“ You okay?” Echo says coming up behind me.
“ I don’t know.” tears roll down my face “ I missed you echo.” I through my paws around her and my crying’s muffled from Echo’s fur.
“ I missed you too. also, WHO WAS THAT?!” Echo screeches.
“ Bramble. I don’t know why but, he wants me dead.” I wipe away my tears and stand up “ We’re the protectors of this key and it’s our duty to make sure it doesn’t get into the wrong hands.” I stare at the wolves that helped me “ I see you made some new friends.” echo laughs.
“ They helped me find you.” she chuckles.
“ Thank you. Wait- what’s that noise?” The ground starts shaking and a portal appears. Uh oh, but it can’t be. I just banished him!
“ That’s right Eve it’s me!” a huge explosion partly knocks me out and all I can make out is Bramble and another key. He swoops down and pins me to the ground “ Just die you little brat!” 
“ I’d rather not!” I push Bramble off of me “ PLEASE STOP! WHAT WILL YOU GAIN BY KILLING ME?!” 
“ I’LL GAIN POWER!” Bramble says laughing like a maniac.
“ What? Do you mean the key will give you power?” 
“ Oh poor simple Eve, you don’t know your true potential. You have power, powers I’ve never seen and I want them!” he darts toward me, again missing. 
“ Powers?”I look down at my paws. 
“ If you won’t give them to me, I’LL MAKE YOU!” Bramble swoops down at Echo and grab her “ I’ll only let her go, IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR POWER!” He grabs a sharp rock and points it to Echo’s neck.
“ ECHO! NOO! YOU’VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME WHEN I NEEDED YOU AND NOW, I’M HERE FOR YOU! I’D BE SO SAD IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED TO YOU! ECHO, I LOVE YOU!” tears slowly roll down my face and then, something amazing happens. I start to levitate and my eyes glow white “ GO AWAY!!!” I dive into Bramble and he lets go of Echo then I whisper into Bramble’s ear “ You’ll never win or be loved.”
 I see tears rolling down his face then I hear him whisper “ But, at least I’ve tried to be loved.” he laughs softly, and I remember Asteroid.
“ Asteroid loves you.” I say softly.
“ Asteroid? Oh my baby girl, why did you have to leave me?!” He sobs into his paws.
“ You left me.” Asteroid? A wolf emerges from the crowd of wolves “ You were just so obsessed with getting the keys, that eventually you left me. I’ve always loved you dad. I thought you didn’t love me.” she walks over to me and gestures for me to move. I get off of Bramble and he stands up. They stare at each other for a minute just in awe.
“ I missed you, Asteroid.” Bramble smiles and Asteroid smiles back. She inches closer to Bramble then they start nuzzling each other.
I look at Echo and she swoops down next to me. She leans on me and I lean back “ I love you so much Eve.” she says softly.
“ I love you too Echo and I know we have many for adventures ahead of us but for now, I want things to stay exactly how they are.”

It was April 2, 3028 and everybody is minding their own business and Dr.Decker and Jake were working on cures for viruses and cancers. Jake is a 28 year old man and has been working at Labs Corp for 8 years now and Dr.Decker has been working at Labs Corp for 40 years now and he is now 72 years old. Everybody knew who Dr.Drecker and Jake were. After they enter the building they go straight to their lab and start working on project Z and everybody else are working on a new facility on a new event on making cars go underwater and starting to make them fly, also Labs Corps is also next door to the invention station. As soon as Dr.Decker and Jake walk in their lab, an alarm goes off and the building is being evacuated and Dr.Decker and Jake are trying to get past all the people that are evacuating trying to get back to the lab to see what happened, but the crowd is to big and brings Dr.Decker and Jake with them. As soon as they go outside they see that the sky is dark gray turning darker every second. Then an alarm goes off and everybody starts to freak out. Then announcement happens and the speaker says chemicals of all sorts of kinds and the last words he says is that good luck to all of you and I will see you in the new world. The Dr.Decker and Jake race to the lab to stay out of the chemicals, but there’s to many people to get past to make it to the lab. So the first thing that they go for is the oxygen masks. I know the first thing your saying is that why is there oxygen masks and that’s because people in the future and live up to 200 years old and still be young and they are also suitable to gas and chemicals, alright back to the story. As soon as Dr.Decker and Jake put on the masks they both have to hold on each others shoulder to not get lost in the raging crowd. As soon as they go into the crowd of raging people they get pushed and shoved and punched and kicked. Even one time a man just hit Jake to try to get Jakes mask but Dr.Decker saves Jake and takes the mask back from the man and gives it to Jake, but Jake became unconscious and Dr.Decker had to hold him up because if he didn’t Jakes legs would get ran over and his mask will be taken again. So Dr.Decker holds Jake up on his shoulders and starts to run as fast as he can. As soon as Dr.Decker making it out of the crowd, almost is arm cut off, he puts Jake down and helps him gain conscious again with his needle. He starts to cough so much he sounded like he was going to explode, but Dr.Decker gave him another , needle and it made Jake feel much better. Then a woman called out that both Jake and Dr.Decker had cures, and everybody started to run after them and Dr.Decker and Jake turned around to see that the lab was right there so they used the code and got into the lab and locked all doors and windows and ran their main lab. They still had to wear the gas mask because that’s where it all started. As soon as they get to their station they find all the antidote they ever had, but they rockets filled with cures. All they needed to do was to set all the rockets into the sky, just one problem was that they were running out of air and that they only have thirty minutes left. All they had was unfinished projects so they started with the first one and it didn’t even work and it takes just about 2 minutes to set up the rocket and shoot it up into the sky. They only created twenty-six cures, so they would only have 4 minutes left, but the people were trying to get inside so they used their cars and weapons like hammers. So Dr.Decker had to go and shut the metal door so they couldn’t get in, but that takes at least three minutes. So Dr. Decker and Jake would only have two minutes oxygen. When Dr.Decker holds off the crazy people he comes back to see Jake passing out. So Dr.Decker speed walks to Jake and shares his oxygen with Jake, until he gained conscious again. But they had to share so that would be twice the oxygen being used. That means they will run out of oxygen faster. After searching and searching for the antidote they finally found it, but they only have a minute. So Dr.Decker and Jake find the antidote and set try to set off the rocket, but they made where you have to have two keys. Then they pull their keys out, but they only have thirty seconds left, so they put the keys in the lock and turn it at the same time and then unlocked the rocket launch and push the launch button and set of the rocket into they sky, but Dr.Decker and Jake pass out and start to die. Jake opened his eyes for a sec and sees that the rocket was successful. 2 months later Dr.Decker and Jake wake up to see tons of people all around thanking them for saving the earth and so many people. When Dr.Decker and Jake get out of the hospital they see that there’s a parde and messages saying thank you for everything. Then the next day they woke up in their massive homes and see that a letter is there and they get the letter at the same time. It says that at 4:00 that they will have a private plan come and take them both to Washington D.C. Then have they come to the white house to say a speech. When both Dr.Decker and Jake walk up the White House steps, they see billions of people standing there and cheering and thanking. The speech Dr.Decker and Jake created said. “ No matter how or tall or have differences, you can always achieve anything with the power of Courage, Love, and Hope.”

	Alinaru (al-a-nar-oo) 7:00:05 AM DONG! DONG! The sound of bells from the 21st century woke me up as I got out of my bed. “Ok today is summer, time to make a model hoverboard!” I opened my kit.
Azoux (a-zo-ex) 7:30:02AM ZROOM! ZROOM! The sound of cars from the 21st century woke me up as I got out of bed. “Ugh it&#39;s monday” I groaned as I pulled on my pants. “Oh wait it&#39;s summer! I need to turn off that alarm.” I said as I got back into my hoverbed.
	Azoux 10:23:57AM //“BREAKING NEWS”// the news anchor said. “Ugh what is it?” I groaned. //“A portal with fire inside just appeared out of nowhere what’s that I just got word that another and another they keep appearing. There is now 5 portals there is fire, water, rock, nature, and space. Our scanner has found life but we can&#39;t go in without dying to the element”//
	Alinaru 10:26:32AM “What?!?! Portals t-t-that is not scientifically possible there are  now 6!?! The last one is sound how can you tell?!?!” I yelled in confusion I ran to my window and sure enough there were  6 portals. “DAD DAAAAD!!!!”  Than creatures flew out of the portals. I recognized them they were from that board game from the 20th century! Dungeons and Dragons!
	Azoux 10:27:23AM “WE’RE ALL GONNA DIE AAAAHHH!!!”I flew down the stairs of my apartment literally on my hoverboard. Along with everyone else to the bunker, I see it, I&#39;m gonna make it! Then I feel claws big claws digging into my back then the ground left me.
	Alinaru 10:28:12AM A kid just got lifted up by a space dragon then it flew away. I heard a roar it was the loudest thing I have ever heard it had a metallic sound to it. Then I looked up the sound dragon was the cause, the sound was so loud that I could see the sound waves they pressed against the bunker and it exploded. Next thing I saw was darkness.

&lt;/div&gt;

	Azoux 3:52:07 AM “Ugh what time is it?” My vision still a blur, “I had a horrible nightmare that dragons were attacking the city.” I opened my eyes and I realized that it wasn’t a nightmare. I was in the ruin of the mall I gathered the strength to stand up, I looked to the left and there was a dragon. “OH SHOOT!” I yelled. I ran but it didn&#39;t chase me. It looked at me with confusion. I went back and slowly put my hand up to it&#39;s back “merrrr” it went. It had gold pure gold on it&#39;s back It flew away.
	Alinaru 4:07:04 AM “Where am I?” I smelled the scent of smoke I looked up and saw fire but it was in a particular shape THE DRAGONS I suddenly remembered. It was a fire dragon but with gold on it&#39;s back? I didn&#39;t seem like it would hurt me so I went closer and it flew away.
	Azoux 4:09:27 AM “The dragon is coming back! But it has something in its mouth” when it landed it dropped whatever it was holding. I picked it up and it was a saddle! “Do you want me to ride you” I put the saddle on and I climbed on it. It flew up and then dove down and right before we hit the ground he flew back up. “I will name you Neptune.”
	Alinaru 4:15:04 AM I saw an orange glow in the air flying down. I assumed it was the dragon when it landed it dropped a saddle and I put it on,  I got on. then he flew into the moon like the old movie ET. “You are now Scorch.”

&lt;/div&gt;

Azoux 12:24:09 PM “Neptune we need to build a shelter if I want to survive.” I stated “merarw?” Neptune asked “a place to live.” I explained. He gestured for me to get on him I did. He flew to where the elevator used to be and lifted up the stall and he got in the chamber. Which was as big as a 21st century classroom and as tall as a three story house. He grabbed a bed from the pod store and pulled in and a couple robo dog bed for him.
	Alinaru 12:37:02 PM “Scorch we need to make sure there are any other survivors” I said “one.” He said in a voice that sounded like a fireplace. “You can talk?!” I said in amazement “only one of the legendary dragons can’t. The Space Dragon who has found a companion like me.” He said “well let&#39;s go find him,” I said
	Azoux 12:48:01 PM “Neptune!!!!!!!!!!” I screamed “F-F-FIRE DRAGON!!!” I yelled as fire hit my back and my clothes burned and withered. I heard Neptunes wings flapping and a lazerbeam shot at the fire and I heard a kid yell “SCORCH!! STOP”
	Alinaru 12:50:04 PM “Hello I am Alinaru” I said “I am Azoux” he replied. He looked like a kid who would sleep in and play video games but would be a good asset in battle. Because he played video games he would be a good strategizer. “This is Neptune, and I&#39;m going to assume that he is Scorch?” he gestured at my dragon “yep.” I replied. “We need a plan to take down the dragons.” he said that proved my theory “kill Sonic rule them all.” said Scorch “who is Sonic?” I asked “sound dragon ruler of us all. I saved you from him. His sound waves are so strong he can move stuff with them. That was how the bunker exploded.” he answered “Geez so how are we gonna take him down?” Azoux said “Surprise he can’t find a surprise.” he answered. “So let&#39;s go get him!” I said “No we need a plan. Me and Neptune will fly above like way above and you and Scorch will go from the left and distract him” Azoux replied Scorch looked at Neptune and they both nodded and then roared thousands of fire and space dragons came flying until there were around 10,000.
	Azoux 1:03:04 PM “OH. MY. GOD,” I said “space dragons can shoot laser beams fire dragons can shoot fire.” Scorch noted “Space dragons follow me up to the stratosphere. Fire dragons go with Alinaru and Scorch.” Azoux said “mradaw” all the dragons said in reply. “RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRAWTING” we heard “That&#39;s him he is over 100 miles away” Scorch said “100 MILES! THAT IS OVER THE SOUND OF 100 AIRPLANES WHEN YOU&#39;RE NEXT TO THEM!!” I cried “I know.” Scorch replied I hopped on Neptune, and said “SPACE DRAGONS COME WITH ME! Scorch go and flank his left side OK AND GO!”
	Alinaru 1:21:38 PM I am doing this it&#39;s too late to turn back oh my god oh my god oh my god. “We are approaching” said Scorch “FIRES I&#39;LL SHOOT THE FIRST FLAME AFTER THAT GO CRAZY!” He yelled to all the other dragons “MRAW” they said in agreement a white dragon was zooming into view “NOW!” I yelled to Scorch fire shot out of Scorch’s mouth “what the-” said Sonic but it was cut off by the fire then a flood happened all of the water dragons flooded us all “AZOUX NOW!!!” I hoped he could hear me then 5,000 lasers shot out of the sky “YES!!” I YELLED  “YOU THINK SPACE AND FIRE CAN DESTROY SOUND, WATER, NATURE AND ROCK!” Sonic roared that was when the space dragons flew down then everything was mayhem.
	Azoux 1:33:09 PM “FIRE MORE LASERS” I yelled to Neptune he did then I heard it he roared. I felt the sound on me it lifted me up it started to crush me. I looked down and saw that Scorch and Neptune were glowing gold then I heard it meteors flying down and crushed Sonic. Right when he was lifting up the meteor a super volcano appeared right on sonic he wasn’t strong enough to fly away then the volcano exploded and sonic disintegrated.
	Azoux 1:59:54 PM “AAAAAAAHHHH” I screamed as I fell from the sky then Neptune flew below me and I landed on him and he flew me to the ground and collapsed of exhaustion “you rule all dragons now.” Scorch mustered before he collapsed “so we rule the dragons now huh” Alinaru said “Yeah do you like medieval cities?” I asked “Heck yea I do!” he replied “let&#39;s make a medieval city!” I said “Zadden” he replied “what?” I asked “let’s name it Zadden”

It was the day 9, 11, 2001, Nekio, Rio, and Noah were sprinting through one of the twin towers, trying to get out.Then the floor above us starts to shake…

Oh, I am so sorry I forgot to introduce myself, I am Nekio and this is the story about how me and my friends, survived 911. We were all 15 at that time Anyway, I should probably start from the beginning.
 
It was a normal Tuesday morning me and my friend Noah are both home schooled by my mom. His dad works at one of the twin towers and Noah and I have always wanted to go with him. Today I asked my mom if I could go with Noah and his dad to work. After 20 minutes of pleading she finally let me go! I texted Noah and said for him to meet me outside of my house in 10 minutes. 

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;10 mins later&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
I was waiting outside when I see Rio walking. He comes over and starts to talk to me.”Hey, Nekio what are you doing out here in that rag you call a dress.” He says.
 I just look at him and say nothing. He keeps on screaming my name but I don’t respond. A few moments later I see Noah&#39;s dad walking towards us, and Noah right behind him. I start to walk up and meet them, while Rio stands there in shock.
 We call a taxi and, before I get in I call out to Rio” I am going to the twin towers, and  have you seen your shirt.” 
Then jump in the car. As we drive off I see him on his phone and looking at us with the dead eye.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;3o mins later&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
We finally get there. We hop out and walk into the building. I look up and my mouth drops open, It&#39;s so beautiful here, I think to myself how lucky it would be to work here. I am so caught up in my thoughts that I don’t notice how many people are walking around in here. Noah hits her lightly in the head then whispers in her ear
” I see that Rio has followed us here.”
She looks behind her, and thinks to herself, Why did I have to open my big mouth whole, and tell him where we were going. 	
I whisper back to him and say” lets just pretend that he is not here and have a good time.” 
He nods his head, and we start to follow Noah’s dad. His dad worked on the 65th floor so it was a long elevator ride with dead silence. We finally reach floor 65th.

	Me and Noah are talking about the place and walking around when, Rio pops out at us. 
I yell at him ‘’ hey what was that for.” 
He just looks at me and, we start to walk away when he grabs me by my hair and pulls me back. 
Noah looks at him with wide eyes, he says” why would you do that, dude that’s not cool”. 
Rio grabs scissors and says” look I am going to cut her hair,” 
Noah looks at him then at me and slaps Rio right in the face!  

	The time about right now is 8:50 and Rio and Noah are caught in a death stair. 
Then we hear a loud “BOOM!” They look out the window and see that a plane had just crashed into the twin tower. 
We all look at each other and Noah says” Look, let&#39;s just stay calm lets go to my dad’s office, and see what he thinks we should do.” 
We all agree and walk over to his office. 
Noah’s dad is in his office pacing back and forth, he looks at us and he says” We have to stay calm we can’t just freak out, I was told to stay here for now and keep working,if it gets worse then we can leave.” we all nod our heads and sit down in his office.
 
	 &lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;30 mins&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
	We have been in his office for awhile now just talking about what has just happened. We our nervous about what is going to happen next. Noah’s dad is still working away.
Then Noah asks Rio “ Why are you always so mean to us?” 
Rio just looks at him with kind eyes and says” My parents always want me to be the best, I don’t want to disappoint them, but you guys were always really smart, and iI was afraid that you guys would start to up my grades. So I figured that the only way to make me feel better was to try and lower your feelings. And I am so sorry I hope we can be friends.” 
I just stared at him with blank eyes. 
Then “ BOOM!” The tower starts to shake and they see that another plane has hit there tower! 
Noah’s dad yells” Get out of here, don’t worry about me I am going to save some other people, GO!” 
With a shocking scream we raced out the door to try and get out.

We all run out of his office and sprint to the stairs there were so many things crumbling, falling, and just things coming apart. We are running down the stairs when we see where the plane had crashed, we stare in shock at this. I think to myself, how could this have happened in the same day, the first plane hit the first tower, then this plane hits this tower, and there are rumors going around about something hitting the pentagon. This was no mistake. We are walking around on this floor where the plane hit and, we see no movement, nothing at all. The plane was full of people who had died in the crash, then that is,”when I see it, a black person, with a gun in his hand was at the pilots seat. At this time he was dead but I could tell there was something up his sleeve. 
Then “BaMM!” The place around us caught on fire somehow, we had to get out! I heard Noah scream as the fire started to get closer. I was afraid that this was going to be the end of us.


But then Rio grabs us by the arms and pulls us with him down the stairs. Just as the fire burns everything in site. We keep on running afraid of what might happen next. We run and run and run. We see a sign saying that we are on the 30th floor, I was so scared that I didn&#39;t even notice how much we had run. The boys looked shocked too. We decided it would be best to take a little break from running and just relax for a little. We all sit down then Rio speaks up and says” Guys, look I am really sorry for the way I treat you guys, it is unfair, and I hope we can all be friends.”
Noah says” Its ok, sorry for slapping you and I think we could be your friends.” 
Rio says” Really, I would love that!”
I say” of course I always believe in 2nd chances, we will totally be your friends.”
Rio says” Thanks for giving me a chance, but are you peeps theristy?”
I say” I am really trusty!” 
	Noah says” We can go in here and see if there is any water in there.”
	So we walk in and see a huge fire and a bunch of people running around,  see a young girl in there screaming her head off. I sprint into the room a garb the little girl and pick her up. 
I ran out with her in my arms but not before, the little girl screams “mommy!” 
I look at the way her mom is and see her jump out of the building! The little girl starts crying her head off but I keep running with her in my arms. I open the door to the stairs and we all start running down and down again. 

We are running down the stairs the little girl is still crying. I am still really shocked and scared about what just happened. This little girl&#39;s mom just jumped out of the building. I am asking myself so many things like, where is she going to stay? What is going to happen to her? Who is going to raise her? She thinks that this little girl is about 4 years old and she was in this madness! Caught up in her own world she doesn&#39;t even realize that Noah is trying to talk to her.
Noah says” Nekio, Nekio, Nekio! Are you there?” 
I say back” Yeah, sorry, what were we talking about?”
Rio says” We were talking to this little girl. Her name is Autumn, I think that her name is amazing. But we saw her mom jump out of the building, so what are we going to now.” 
I say” well she just had the worst experience ever seeing her mom do that, I can’t imagine what that would do to me. I would just feel so bad if she was sent to a foster home.” 
I think to myself maybe my mom and me can raise her! So then she does not have to go to a foster home. I say “ If we can get out of here maybe me and my mom could take care of her, but that&#39;s only if we get out of here. 


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;45 mins later&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
We have been walking and running then walking some more. But we have finally made to the 1 floor when we hear the floor above us start to rumble Autumn screams, we run over to the door but, not before the floor above us comes down on the door so we can’t get out. 
I hear Noah yell “ I see a widow come on!”
 We run over to the window and, the boys hop out of the widow and I hand them Autumn, then the walls start to crumble around me. I stand there dead in fear, then noah jumps through the window grabs me in his arms and pushes me out the window. Then he jumps out the window, just before the building comes crashing down, he grabs me again and he runs away with me in his arms. When we are  far away, I realize that he is still holding me. 
I yell at him” PUT ME DOWN!” 
He says’’ ok ok, oh and by the way your welcome for saving your life.”
I say” oh ya sorry.”
Then I see Noah&#39;s dad standing over us and looking at us with wide eyes. Then Noah sees him. 
He says” Noah have you gotten a new girlfriend?”
Noah says” well not yet.’’ Then he gives me the dead eye.
I just stand there with a red face looking at him. Then I see my mom and I ran over to her. She is crying her head off. I give her a huge hug!
She says” I was so worried about you! Are you ok?”
I say” yes and you should thank Noah he was the one to save me. Here follow me i will show you were the others are.” 
I walk over there with my mom following with me. When we get there Autumn is crying. 
My mom says” who is that?”
I say” That’s Autumn her mom jumped out of the building so I saved her, and mom  I was wondering if she could live with us since her dad is dead.”
My mom says” Of course anyone can stay with us!”



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;7 years later&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
Me and Noah started dating from that day on. I found out that I love him and that I never wanted to leave him. As for Autumn, me and my mom raised her. She is now 11 years old and she is such a sweet child. Anyway, today I am meeting Noah. Up at the were the twin towers came down ( we are meeting at 7:00),, so I get on my nieces dress and start to walk down there. When I turn the corner, to see him, he was standing there in the middle, with a bunch of rose petals in a heart shape. Candles lit in a perfect path way to the heart, nobody was here. As I walked down to where he was standing there with a huge smile on his face.
Then he says” Nekio, I remember when we were here and I was holding you ,then twin tower had crashed, when I was holding you I knew I never wanted to let go. You bring the best out of m and I hate myself for life if this bond we had were to leave.” 
I say” Naoh I love you with all of my heart and I will never let go of you.” 
As I finish saying that he gets down on one knee and says “ Nekio Lilian White, will you marry me?” 
I start crying so hard and then say” YES!” 
We hugged each other and then my mom, Rio and, Autumn come out from their hiding spots and come and join the group hug. We all just stay there in a huge group hug for the longest amount of time till the sun goes down.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 170%;&#39;&gt;\
    &lt;span style=&quot;color: teal;&quot;&gt;Back to real time&lt;/span&gt; \
&lt;/div&gt;
So that’s how me and your father survived 911, I say to my cute little children. There both girls and their names are River and Lillian, Lillian is 9 years old and, River is 12 years old. The are looking at me with their mouths wide open.
River says” Did that really happen?”
Lillian says” Did you really save a little girl&#39;s life?” 
  I nod my head to both of them and say” Yes, this is all true, but right now it’s your guys bedtime. You have school tomorrow come on let&#39;s go say good night to dad.”
We enter Naoh’s and my room and the girls both say at the same time say” Good night daddy!”
Noah says” Good night my sweet angles.” 
As I walk the girls to bed and say goodnight I keep wondering how Autumn is and if she is doing good. Then I walk back to my room and see that Noah is already asleep. I grab my phone and text Autumn saying “ Hi.”

	Chapter 1\
&lt;/div&gt; 
 
Riverside High, a school where nothing happens and nothing exciting takes place. A high school where there are normal students and normal teachers. Ella, a current student at the school was sitting in the student lounge reading her favorite book, Gone With The Wind. A classic story she has always loved. Ella has always loved school, just the students made it dreadful for her. There is nothing more that Ella loved then to read a good book. She was used to being alone, she only has one friend which she considers her best friend. She knows that she is lonely, but if she were to pick to be alone or have many friends then she would be alone. 

Ella had gotten lost in her thoughts, when she noticed all of the yelling, talking and laughter was gone. She was late for class and the bell had already rung. She has never been late before, her father always told her that if she acts up then she would be grounded for life. Her family has always been proud of Ella, but she still doesn’t know why she has to be perfect. Walking down the empty hallway makes her feel calm, more comfortable with the way none was yelling or screaming. She was almost to her class when she spotted an open door with some people talking inside. She peeked in to see what was happening expecting to see teachers talking, or the student council meeting, but to her surprise it was three students, one was on the ground and the others were holding him by the collar on his shirt. She didn’t know what to do, so she got her phone out and took a picture. When she took the picture her phone made a sound and the other kids heard. Ella was scared, they walk forward, and without even thinking she ran. She was being chased by those kids and to her surprise she ended up at the front office where she went into the office and ran to the principal&#39;s office. She knocked on the door to see if anyone was there, but nobody answered. She knocked again and then went in. None was in so she grabbed a piece of paper and wrote down. Dear Mr. Brown, I was in your office earlier and you weren&#39;t there, I just wanted to report some behavior, that has been done by two of the students. I&#39;m not sure about their names but if you would like to see me so I can show you the picture I’ve gotten on my phone then call me down whenever you are free. Your student,   Ella Rivers. Ella was not sure if she lost them, but she knew that she was safe in the office. She opened the door and walked out. She didn’t see them so she headed back to the classroom. When she got there, nobody was there. She was confused. Then she realized that it was lunch time and she had spent her whole time trying to get away from some seniors.																 She didn’t bring any lunch but she knew she had to meet Jayden on the roof. They usually go to the rooftop, and hang out and talk about their troubles. Ella really thinks it helps Jayden get things off her chest. Jayden has always had depression and Ella thinks she is helping her. When Ella was making her way to the stairs, she spotted the kid that was chasing her. She was praying that he wouldn’t look back, but it was too late. Out of the corner of his eye he saw her and yelled “HEY!” Ella couldn’t go anywhere because the hallway was too crowded. She pushed her way through the crowd up the stairs and onto the rooftop. She saw Jayden sitting there with her lunch. “ Jayden!” Ella screamed. Jayden looked at her and back to her lunch. “Why are you late Ella?” She has said in a serious voice. “I was being chased by a senior.” Ella was gasping for air, sputtering words at Jayden. “ Do you mow his name?” Jayden had gotten up and faced Ella with anger in her eyes. “ No, but I don’t know where he is, he could be anywhere looking for me!” Ella was now in panic, she didn’t know what to do if that guy got his hands on her. “ Come down Ella, I&#39;m here for you.” Jayden was now hugging Ella. She was in shock that she was hugging her, she has never seen Jayden hug anyone, but she felt so comfortable with Jaydens hands wrapped around her. 


A few minutes has gone by and Ella hadn’t seen the boy anywhere. She was starting to get less and less worried. Looking down on all the people talking below made her feel notios. She doesn&#39;t like heights and that is one of the many things she is afraid of. She always looked up to Jayden for her role model, not for her behavior but for her kindness toward her and her lack of fears. Jayden was done with her lunch, and was looking down at the people with Ella. She couldn’t get her mind off of her family. She had many problems with her family and she never wants to go home at the end of the day, thinking that her mom would beat her up or her dad yelling at her for no reason. She never showed that she had problems. Not a lot of people know that she even has parents. She never talks about them and none has ever seen them with Jayden, but Ella knew all of this, Ella was the one person that Jayden can open up to about her problems. Jayden trusts her not to tell anyone about her troubles, and she is certain she would never do that.


The bell had rung a few minutes after they left the roof, Ella had Math and Jayden had history. They both went their separate ways when Jayden ran into a man, he looked like a teacher but she wasn’t sure if he was a student or a teacher. “ Sorry sir, I need to get to class before I’m late.” Jayden was polite to adults, a lot of people wouldn’t expect that from a student that gets in trouble a lot but Jayden tries her best not to get into more trouble then she could already get in. “ Jayden, right? I was actually looking for you, your dad had called and said that you needed to go home for the day.” The man looked worried. “ Oh...okay...can I just finish this period and then I can go home?” Jayden was trying her best not to burst out in tears.” That should be fine, but you have to go right home after your class ends.” The man walked away and turned to the front office. Jayden was worried, she has never been called home before by her father. She was afraid of her parents, she was always afraid when they talked to her about her grades or behavior. Jayden went to class, the class was an hour long and to her it felt like minutes. 


Jayden went home and was surprised to see her dad standing in the front doorway. He had a mad look on his face, but Jayden didn’t do anything wrong. She walked up and stood right in front of her dad. “ Jayden, I am sorry if I had been harsh on you, but you are grounded for the rest of the year.” He looked stern, and Jayden was shocked by his words. “B-But why?” Jayden was going to cry. “ I saw your report cards from math and science, you have been failing and  getting F’s.” He turned back in the house and went into the living room. Jayden was starting not to care about her grades and if she would get grounded for getting bad grades, then she would need a tutor. Jayden walked in and ran into her room. She didn’t know what to do, but then she had a thought. She grabbed her jacket and snuck out the window in her room. She closed it trying not to make a sound. 

	Jayden knew this was a bad idea, knowing that her dad would be mad not knowing where she was. 


	She was on her way to Ella’s house when she remembered that school wasn’t over yet. She didn’t want to make a big scene at school so she decided to go to Ella’s house. When she got there she rang the doorbell expecting Ella’s mom to open the door, but it was her dad. “ Hello, Mr. Rivers, I just wanted to see if it was ok if i take Ella on a skydiving trip....so she can get over her fear of heights.” Jayden tried to have a worried look on her face to make it seem like she was worried about Ella. “ Sure, anything for my little girl, she has been so sad about you being so depressed lately, I just want her to be my happy little girl again.” His look on his face looked sad like he was happy that she was going with Jayden. ‘ Great! Can you just sign the form that is online?” Jayden said with happiness.” Sure, and when will you be doing this skydiving trip?’’ He said with curiosity. “ I would like to take tomorrow!” Jayden was sure that her dad would not let her go tomorrow, but she had to try. “ That sounds fine, thank you Jayden for putting an effort into having my little girl happy.” He closed the door and Jayden ran back home hoping that her dad didn’t notice that she was gone. 


When she got back, she went to the back of her house and climb through the window. She didn’t see her dad anywhere, so she thought that he didn’t notice. She opened the door and walked to the living room where her dad was seated watching tv. There was no way her dad would let her go, since she was grounded and that it was really dangerous. Before she walked into the living room, she thought to herself if she should go in and talk to him or if she should just make it seem like her dad signed the paper online. Turning back to her room she her heard dad talking to himself, “ Why does she have to be such a hard child? I wish June was still here to help me.” Jayden was frozen in place, the thought of her mother made her sad. The last time she saw her was in the house fire years ago, when she was ten. Not seeing her mother in six years was hard for her. Without even thinking she ran into the livingroom and hugged her dad with tears in her eyes. “ I am so sorry dad.” The picture came back into her mind, her mother holding her in her arms with hot flames around them. The last thing Jayden remembers was being in a warm blanket on the sidewalk next to the burnt down house. “ Hunny, I&#39;m sorry too, but you are still grounded.” Jayden got up and went back to her room. Her mother would not want her to lie about her dad signing something so important, but she needed to do this for her best friend.


Ella had just gotten home from school and her dad looked at her happily. “ Honey guess what, you&#39;re going on a skydiving trip with Jayden!” I want to look surprised she never thought that this would happen and she was a little scared too. “ What do you mean I&#39;m going on a skydiving trip, you know I&#39;m afraid of heights?” Ella was almost yelling but she was very scared about what was going to happen to her if she would die or if she would get stranded anywhere. “ We know you&#39;re scared of heights but you need to get over that fear in Jaden wanted that too, so she&#39;s taking you on a trip be happy about that please.” I wouldn&#39;t want to go at all but she knew that she had to do this for a best friend, there is nothing better than making and Jayden happy.”  I don&#39;t want to go,  but I will do this for Jayden, and you guys.”  I was scared by her response but she knew that she didn&#39;t have to think about it that much. “  So where am I going?”  Ella was scared to hear the response. “  You&#39;re going tomorrow!” her dad said in a very happy voice. “ why did you not tell me this,  why did you  tell me at the  last minute!”   Ella didn&#39;t expect this answer.  Ella the she had homework so she went upstairs and slammed her door.  she claimed on to her bed and was about to cry but she don&#39;t want to be a crybaby, so she got her homework out and started doing it.  an hour went by and she finished her homework and she went downstairs to eat dinner and then she went to bed. 


The next morning was just as bad for Jayden,  she woke up and knew that she had to go get Ella so she packed her things. Her dad was still asleep so she left a note saying that she went to the mall and went grocery shopping and that should be back by the end of the day.  she went out the door quietly and ran over to Ella’s house. She knocked on the door and and Ella came to the door. “  I&#39;m here!”  Jayden said in a happy voice.   Ella looks tired, she barely got sleep last night thinking about all the dangers of skydiving. “ come on a lad don&#39;t be a party pooper!”  Jayden grabbed her wrist and ran out the door.  They took  Jayden&#39;s car and they drove to the skydiving building.  it wasn&#39;t that far from her house so it wasn&#39;t a far drive, Aladdin say a thing the whole way she was too scared to say anything.  she was looking out the window looking at all the trees that passed by she couldn&#39;t get her mind off of skydiving. 

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 2 Skydiving Trip\
&lt;/div&gt; 

	When they got to the skydiving building the parked and sat in the car. There were many thoughts going through both of their heads. There was no turning back now, they were both going to skydive if they like it or not. 


	Many minutes past by and none said a thing. Jayden opened her mouth but didn’t say anything. The air was thin, and they were breathing heavily. The sound of the ocean was peaceful, but they knew that they had to do this so Ella would get over her fear. “ Ella, I know you don’t want to do this but you need to get over your fears.” Jayden looked at Ella, she looked like she was going to cry. Ella got out of the car and walked to the door. Jayden got out and walked up behind her. 


When they went in they saw a deak and an empty room with a tv and couch. It looked abandoned. When they walked to the front desk none was there so they rand the little bell that was sitting right in front of them. About a minute later someone came to the desk. “ How may I help you?” The woman looked tired, like she had just woken up “ Yes, we would like to go skydiving. Our parents signed our form on your website.” Jayden was scared thinking about what her dad would do if he found out she lied. “ Can I have your names please?” The woman looked a little annoyed, she didn’t want to be there. “ Jayden Lee and Ella Rivers.” Ella looked to the woman and smiled and looked back down at the floor. “ Yes, here you are, looks like you girls will be going in about thirty minutes.” Jayden walked to the couch and sat down and Ella followed. “ If we get stuck, then that will be your fault.” Ella said with a little anger in her tone. 

The next thirty minutes felt long to both of them. They were both worried but Jayden was excited. She wishes Ella could see why she would do something like this. The smell of the ocean eased them both. “ Can Ella Rivers and Jayden Lee come to the launch room?” A different woman walked in, she looked nice, but annoyed. The girls got up and walked behind the lady. She looked older and she had a particular smell to her. Her hair was short and red. She was wearing a blue dress and some red lipstick. SHe looked like a nurse to both of them. They went into a room with a door, this room was small but with suits and parachutes. “ You have to get these on before you go, they will keep you safe.” With no hesitation Ella got the suit on. “ Ella, come on this is supposed to be fun, don’t worry about bad things.” Jayden was getting annoyed by her sour behavior. “ This is your fault, you made me go on this trip without checking with me.” Ella was angry, she never done something that she didn’t want to do. “ well, sometimes you need to deal with things you don’t want to do.” She had gotten up, and went out the door. Ella followed behind her. 


It was still pretty early in the morning and they were both tired. Jayden didn’t want to deal with Ella’s behavior but she knew she had to. Ella on the other hand was angry that she had to do something she didn’t want to do. She couldn’t turn back now, and she isn’t really good at fighting back in an argument. They got on the plane still silent, and still straight faces. Inside Ella was scared and she wished she just jumped out of the car when they were driving to the building. They sat down and waited for the pilot to come aboard. They both looked down at their feet trying to avoid eye contact with each other. “ Why hello there girls, today we are going to go over the ocean and next to a small island. Once you guys jump then we will come down and pick you guys up and come back here!” The man startled both of the girls. He looked older as well, but very polite he seemed to have a good morning, unlike the other employees they encountered earlier. The man was with another man that stayed silent. They both went to the front and sat down right next to the controls. It looked confusing, like a jigsaw puzzle that someone couldn’t figure out. He started the engine and hit some buttons, and then they flew off. The flew off the ramp and into the air. It was loud, like a helicopter was flying right next to them. The side of the plane was a door that was open. 

It took a few minutes to get to the right spot, but they got there. Ella and Jayden were both silent, they didn’t want to speak. One of the men got out of his seat and went to the back. “ OK GIRLS, SO I&#39;M NOT SURE ANYONE TOLD YOU BUT I AM COMING WITH YOU&lt; SINCE YOU AREN’T TRAINED!” He was yelling at the top of his lungs because it was so loud. By that statement that made both of the girls feel better. They both got up and walked towards the man almost falling off their feet. Both of them grabbed onto him, he grabbed the belt that was on their suites. “ OK, JAYDEN YOU GO BEHIND ME AND ELLA YOU BEHIND ELLA!”  They did what they were told and they walked to the edge of the plane. “ 1….2…..3!” They all jumped and flew through the air. Jayden and Ella were screaming, but they were having a good time. Before they knew it they were in the water, they came to the surface of the water. The were gasping for air, but with smiles on their faces. “ That was awesome!” They both screamed with happiness. They knew that had to swim to the island, so they did. They followed right behind the man. 


Once they got to shore they heard a loud crash on the island not too far from where they were. They ran toward the sound and sure enough if was the plane. It had crashed with pilot still inside. They ran up to the plane and went inside. They found the pilot, but we was dead. They were all panicking so they looked through the plane to see if there was any first aid kit or survival kit. Jayden was looking toward the tail of the plane, and she found a survival kit. “ Hey, guys I found a survival kit!” They both came running to her. There was not a lot of tools in there to survive but they could live with it. They looked through the bag and they found some bagged food, a fishing kit, a hunting knife, and a filter for water. They had a lot of food, enough so they can survive for a few days. “ Ok, girls we need to find some water, and not the ocean water. We also need to make some shelter and a fire.” Ella and Jayden knew what to do since they went to a survival camp when they were younger. They knew that basics but they needed some help.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 3 The Survival\
&lt;/div&gt; 

	They didn’t know much on survival, but they knew the basic needs to survive. They knew how to make a shelter, filter water, find food, and to light a fire. The man that went down with them was not trained to deal with something like this so he was no help. “ Ella, you go find some wood for shelter, and I will find some water and try to find something to hold it in.” Ella looked mad, Jayden knew why but tried not to mention that she was sorry. They all walked off trying to find materials for shelter. The man went with Jayden to find water, “ I’m so sorry about all of this, I wish I knew these skills, but I was never trained to do something like this.” He looked like he was about to panic. : It’s alright, there is not a lot that we need to do, but one of our priorities is to find help.” They walked on, they were talking and introduced themselves. The man&#39;s name was Alex and he was from Maine. Jayden never would have thought that he would be from Maine, he seemed like he was from the city. He has brown hair, blue eyes, and a nice smile. He was in his early twenties, and just moved to Riverside town last year. 


The island was small, but it seems big. There were a lot of trees and no animals. There was a little creek that Alex found not too far off from the plane crash. The water was clean so they weren’t worried about getting sick by it. They saw a few shaped rocks that looked like bowls, or something that can hold water, so they filled them up with water. They were on their way back when they were talking about how fun skydiving was when Alex asked “ Why did you girls go skydiving anyways?”  Jayden didn’t really want to answer that question so she gave a simple answer. “ Uhh, because Ella is scared of it and I wanted her to get over her fears.” Jayden was certain he was going to ask another question. “ Ok, it’s nice to have a friend that helps you get over your fears.” Jayden looked at him and nodded. 

Once they got back they found a fire and some surrounding wood on the plane. “ You guys took long, so I decided to build something temporary.” Ella seemed to have a mad face but was trying not to show it. She never liked being alone in an unfamiliar place, so that was one of the reasons why she was mad. She was sitting on a log by the fire with her hands in her face. She got up and went into the plane to see if there was anything useful they could use other then the things they found in the kit. She found some blankets, so she took them out and put them into the plane. She was trying not to look at the dead body behind her. His face was burned and there was blood all over his shirt.

A couple hours later they went to the front of the island and tried looking for help. They figured if they found someone then they could drop them off by the bay back in Riverside. They spent hours in the same place, waiting and waiting for help. The had finally gave up and went back to the plane. Since they had nothing to do they ventured around the island, looking for something to eat or to survive on. They gathered around the fire not too long after and started to eat. They tried not to eat too much or they would run out of food. 

	When they went to sleep they talked about doing shifts. Jayden was going to watch first, she is going to watch for 2 hours and then Alex will take the second shift for 3 hours. Ella doesn’t want to do it so they didn’t make her. Jayden and Alex have been trying all night to cheer Ella up but nothing seems to be working. A few days have gone by and they don’t have much food left. They have been doing the same things everyday. Until the day something happened. 


	It was on a Wednesday, they weren’t sure what day it was though. They didn’t know the time or what day of the week it was. They were at the beach when Jayden spotted a shape, a weird shape for being out in the ocean. She ran back and got some wood and went back to the beach. She started a fire and started shouting. “ HELP, PLEASE HELP!” Jayden has been screaming the same things for the past ten minutes. Then she noticed that the shape got closer and closer. She waved her hands and continued shouting. About twenty minutes later she could finally figure out what it was, it was a ship. A big ship that looked like it was dropping off supplies of some sort. The boat stopped, and someone climbed down a rope and walked up on the beach. The others heard Jayden shouted and joined her on the beach. “ Wat is going on here?” The man looked old, he looked like he hasn’t had a shower in days. “ Yes, we have been here for days and our plane crashed.” Alex said without hesitation. “ Do you guys need help?’’ The man said. “ Please, we need to get back to Riverside.” Jayden said with excitement. “ Well, I am going there too, so you guys can tag along. It’s not too far from here.” The man walked back and climbed up the rope. The three followed him onto the boat. It looked bigger on board. There were barrels and boxes all around the deck. It looked like a pirate ship. Ella didn’t like being on a boat. She hated the water, and when she was little she went on a boat and she got sea sick. Alex and Jayden were happy that they were finally being rescued. “ Just stay on the deck for the next thirty minutes.” They did as they were told. The next thirty minutes felt long. 


Once they got back to Riverside they waited until the boat stopped and slid down the rope. Ella got off first then Alex then Jayden. They all ran to the nearest house. They knocked on the door and a lady came. “ If you want to advertise something i’m not interested.” The lady looked mean, “ No, please we need a phone so we can call out parents, please.” Ella cried. The lady looked like she didn’t care too much, just the fact that she was letting strangers into her house. “ FIne, as you will. “ She opened the door more and they all walked in. “ The phone is in the living room.” she said. They all ran to the living room and Jayden called her dad. She had forgotten that he didn’t know where she was. “ Dad! Dad! Come help please we are near the dock.” Jayden was almost yelling in the phone. Ella and Alex watched as she told her father what had happened. 


Jaydens dad got to the docks, and Jayden ran up to him crying. He hugged her, and she hugged back. “ Honey, we are going to have a talk when we get home.” Jayden didn’t care that she was in trouble just the fact that she was home. Ella’s parents arrived not too long after Jayden’s dad got there. They ran up to her and hugged her with joy. “ My baby’s okay.” Her parents said in relief. When everyone went home Jayden and her dad went into the living room and talked. Her dad was more happy that Jayden was home then he was mad at her. Ella and her parents were all happy that they were home and for Alex he went home and rested. The end.

	Prologue\
&lt;/div&gt; 


	This is a story about a girl named Isabelle (that’s me) and I live in Aspen CO and go to Sunflower High. Sunflower High had a good history until Victoria came. Victoria used to be my best friend, but we got in a huge fight and she left the country as she said “forever”. But what  happened is things with her family got complicated and she moved back with her boyfriend, Tanner. Some background knowledge on Tanner, he graffitis our town and has been to jail twice, so he does not have the best reputation.

In addition to his bad reputation Tanner had a few enemies, including Michael, Victoria’s ex. Michael was madly in love with Victoria. When Victoria announced she was leaving “forever”, they tried long distance dating but it didn’t exactly work. Soon enough Victoria broke up with Michael so she could be with Tanner, which we all didn’t know until she came back after a mysterious two years. Nobody knows about her past except for the part where her family got complicated, but she never told us what that meant. Anyway, when Michael saw Victoria walking in with Tanner he was so mad that he punched Tanner, they got in a huge fist fight and guess who won… the principle.

 I know what you’re thinking, the principle can’t win, but he is the one who punched Tanner and then lost his job, but can you blame him, the kid wasn&#39;t supposed to be at school. Technically he was trying to protect us, so thanks principal Winston. Anyway Tanner talked himself into the school. But yeah, that is now the bad history of Sunflower High. Some more about me is that I am a senior and I love to do yoga. I also love to eat Itailan and love to Netflix and chill, my favorite color is turquoise and I love turtles. I sadly have  a bad relationship with my family and I live in an apartment with my dreamy boyfriend Josh. Now let’s explain high school life, I love literacy, hate math, the rest is meh. I am also head cheerleader, but that’s really all that is important. Well now that you know a little bit about me, let’s jump into the real story.

	&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 1\
&lt;/div&gt; 

	 “Come on Josh we gotta go!” Sorry I should probably tell you what is going on, today is the first day of school and I am so excited. It feels like my sixth birthday all over again. You know when you are little, the most important part of the day is opening presents and you feel so overwhelmed? Well that is how I feel right now. 
“Coming!” Josh yelled back, you could hear his footsteps, they were as loud as an angry mob of elephants. We both ran out the door and we got into our shiny black jeep. We had ten extra minutes to spare so we hit up starbucks. We rolled up to the drive thru. 
“Hi what would you like today?” asked the barista. Josh said  “I would like a tall pumpkin spice latte.”
“Alright anything else for you?” the barista replied. 
“Yes, give me one moment” said Josh. “Belle (my nickname) what do you want?” Josh said. 
“A tall mango dragon fruit refresher, please” I said. 
“Okay anything else?” Josh asked.
“Nope” I replied. 
“Alright sorry, we would also like a tall mango dragon fruit refresher.” said Josh breaking the silence. 
“Alright anything else?” the barista said.
 “Nope.” 
“Alright $10.25 at the first window, thank you”
 “No, thank you.” 
“So you excited for the first day?” I asked. 
“No, not at all, it almost seems like I am going back to being grounded all the time, ya know.” 
“No I don’t know, because I have never been grounded, you know what I mean.” I replied, but he didn’t respond maybe he was mad or something.
We pulled up to the window.
 “Here is your order, have a nice day” the barista said. 
“You too.” Josh replied. 
“Here” Josh said handing me my drink. 
“Thanks, are you mad?” 
“Yes.” 
“Why?” 
“I just am okay.”
 “Okay sorry” wow what a brat! Why would he do that, he loves me, we live together, we are in the same first period and are partners in everything! Oh my gosh, this is our first fight!
 
&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt; 


“Can I get out and walk to school” I asked Josh, let me catch you up. Me and Josh were getting starbucks when something went wrong and we got in a huge fight then I wanted to get out of the car. Anyway, this is what he said. 
“Sure, see you in class.” 
“Wow…” What the heck, I put him under a test and this is what he says “Sure, see you in class” basically he was saying get out of here now and don’t talk to me in class. Well at least he got one bad grade, an F- from me! Well, I got out of the car and walked to class, somehow I beat him and I saw Lina when I was getting to my locker. Lina is my best friend however we just started hanging out after we just recently met at a party. But the whole school year before this, we had lockers next to each other and the same class period, so I hung out with her and Josh a lot this summer. Just recently she started dating Michael, (the one who punched Tanner and got detention for two weeks.) They were so cute together and they had met at the same party she and I met at. Lucky for her, she found her two most favorite people at the same party. Enough about Lina, we talked for like five minutes and then we went to homeroom. We can skip the whole school day but overall me and Josh didn’t make up and I hung out with Lina and Michael all day. Then I had cheer practice and Josh and I ran into each other because his football practice ends at the same time. 
“Hi” I said. 
“Hi, I missed you, I know you are mad but please get in the car so I can explain.” 
“Sure” I said. We got in the car, obviously I was mad so when we got in I slammed the door cutting the air making the air inside tense and very hot almost like being in the dessert. He started explaining and after a long two hours I understood. His mom had just died and they already had the funeral and nobody invited him. His older brother said he had invited him and that Josh said he didn’t want to come, so then his whole family hated him. 
“Wow” I said aloud, “I am so sorry.” 
“It’s fine.” he replied. 
“No it’s not, let’s go home and watch Star Wars okay?”
 “Okay.”
 
&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 3\
&lt;/div&gt; 

Ding, ding, ding, wow the bell was loud today, almost as loud as five classes combined (with all of them talking), “Let’s go pack now that we are out of prison.” Josh replied yelling over the bell. Let me explain, the last few weeks have been as boring as staring at a white wall for eight hours, but tomorrow we get to leave to go to Muir Woods in California and stay for two weeks, so know you know why we needed to pack. After a few hours of packing (and some homework) I got into bed. My thoughts were roiling like a tornado, they were all about the trip. Which isn’t surprising, I was so excited. Here were some of my thoughts. I am in first class sitting by Josh, across the aisle is Lina and Michael. Thank gosh I sit near her so I can talk to her. I know it’s not a lot, but with that I fell asleep.
Beep beep beep beep beep. “Good morning” I say to Josh walking into his room.
“Good morning” he said annoyed, he obviously didn’t remember about our trip. 
“Time to go, let’s head to the airport!” I said. 
“Why?”
“Because we are going to California, remember?”
“Oh ya” he said.
“Well let’s head over there.”
“Okay let’s go, but first don’t we have to get clothes on and out of our pajamas?”
“Oh right, sorry, I am just so excited.” I leaned in to give a kiss but it was a peck. Like come on people!! Well guess my first kiss wasn’t as romantic as I thought it would be. No flowers or birds singing, and the window didn’t fling open from the wind like in the movies. Ah, that word movies. To me it means that it usually is fake but sometimes it is real, sorry Cinderella but not alot of people get their “happily ever after”, it’s a dream. Thirty minutes later… “Come on Josh, we are going to be late!” 
“No we aren’t!”
“Yes we are, our flight is an hour away and the airport is thirty minutes away and we need to make sure we make it through security in thirty minutes!”
“Okay, okay, chill.”
“If you want me to chill, take me to the airport!”


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt; 

We arrived in California after a long two hours. Our teachers lead us to the bus and we got on the bus to go to the campsite. After another long two hours we arrive at Muir Woods. “It’s so cool” I say aloud.
“I know it’s so naturey” Lina said.
“Well duh, it smells like one thousand cows just pooped.”
“I don’t think so, I think it smells like a field of flowers.”
“Really?”
“Yep.”
“Everyone get in your cabins, we already told you where they are, and who you are with. Well, what are doing standing there, go!” said Mrs. Aqua. 
I forgot to tell you my roommates, they are me, Lina, Josh, Michael and Marissa. Let me tell you a little bit about Marissa she has never had a boyfriend and likes to read. She doesn&#39;t have many friends, although I have tried to be her friend, she just says she doesn&#39;t want friends. Sadly, I have always known she wanted a friend. While we settled into our cabin, Lina goes on a walk and while she is on her walk, she her ex-best friend Victoria and Victoria’s boyfriend Tanner go missing! Though Isabelle hates Victoria, Lina was missing too, so she and Josh went to go looking for them. When she finds Victoria she sees her with a green skinned pimple faced person with a wand, you can probably guess, she is a witch! “Hi Isabelle…”

&lt;/div&gt; 

 “Who are you?” I asked.
“I am the witch that is trying to kill you, obviously.” Wow what a sassy witch I thought.
“Anywho, let’s get to what I was going to say, I will give you one thousand dollars to kill Isabelle, Victoria do you accept?” 
“Yes” said Victoria. 
“Noooooooo!” I say, “Why do you want to kill me?” 
“Because” whoosh, bang, kirplunk, whiz, zooz. “Now Tanner and Victoria are under the spell, I would start running if I were you.” said the witch. “Isabelle and Josh, we are coming for you!” 
“Come on Josh, and this time no stalling!” I say.
“Well duh, come on we need to find a shelter that they can’t find or get in!” Josh said.
“I know! I see an old abandoned house painted pink and Victoria hates abandoned houses, plus I think Tanner hates them too!”
“And witches hate pink!” said Josh “This is perfect.”
We sprinted inside the house. “We made it!” I say, but I heard Lina and ran out of the house. But they were impersonating her, Josh and me were caught.

 “Well that was easy” Victoria said. Let me catch you up. We came across a witch that wanted to kill me and gave Tanner and Victoria one thousand dollars to kill me. We thought we were safe but we really weren’t when they lured us out of the pink house. So yes, that is where we left off. “Yeah it was, well now that we have you guys, let’s begin” Victoria said. “First you each have to kill one deer, one for you guys to eat and one for us” said Tanner. 
We first had to kill one deer. It was so bloody and so sad, but it was either the deer or us. Sadly, we both succeeded (for the deer it was sad but for us it was good). “You guys must make a shelter for us and for you, so two shelters.” Tanner said. Uh! Now we have to make a shelter. We found good wood and made two shelters in thirty minutes. Once again we both succeed. “Now you must hunt for fish so we have more food, you need to find eight fish total” Victoria said. I mean we already killed a deer, why did we have to do something that involves blood again? We succeeded again. “Now make a fire so we can cook the fish and we can stay warm.” Tanner said. Come on, a fire, like why! We made one, so we did succeed. “Now you have to run two miles, when you reach the end you may leave.” said Victoria.
“Go!” said Tanner. We ran with a purpose, but when we got to the end, there was a surprise awaiting us...

  Chapter 6\
&lt;/div&gt; 

“Hi, you really think we would let you go so easily?” Victoria said.
“What do you want?” I say angrily. Let me catch you up me and Josh got lured out of the house and we have done a series of events Tanner and Victoria were supposed to let us go but they didn’t. Now you are caught up on what happened
“I want you to die, I want the money!” said Victoria. She gave me the death stare with red, blood thirsty eyes. “I want the money.” she said “I want the money!!” she yelled
“Well, while Victoria yells about money, let me explain this. Josh you will battle me and Isabelle will battle Victoria, after the battle you will have ten minutes to escape, if not you will die.”
“Okay, well when do we start?” I said.
“In ten minutes” Tanner replied.
After a long stressful ten minutes we begin to battle.
“Ready to die?” asked Victoria.
“Nope, because I won’t die.” I say with confidence.
We battle and battle, I win and start running. Josh didn’t get out when I did, so I ran waiting for him to come. But he never did, where is he? But the main question that was in my head is, did Josh die?


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
  Chapter 7\
&lt;/div&gt; 

 “Josh!” I yell. Let me catch you up. I had gotten out at the end of the forest and I had waited for Josh at the end, but he didn&#39;t come. Did he not make it out of the battle against Tanner? And that is what happened. “Josh, Josh!” I yelled “Are you there, are you even alive!” I said, tears streaming down my face. “I have to run right?” I said to myself aloud. “Yes run” said my instincts, so I run with tears falling on the cold ground “Isabelle where are you?” Oh no, Victoria is coming “Time is up, come out come out wherever you are. Come on Isabelle where are you?” Victoria said furiously looking.
“I am over here!” I said running the opposite way to trick her. I have to leave I thought. So I ran as fast as a cheetah and made it back to where I was, alive! Though I want to go back to look for Josh, I know it is too dangerous and so I continue to head to the airport. After a long two hours and some sore muscles, I reach the airport. I had enough cash on me to buy myself a ticket back home. When I arrive home, I find... a secret note.

“Time for school, Darla” my mom yells up our barren hallway
	“Coming” I scream back. I get out of my creaky bed and stretch. “Why can’t I just be homeschooled?” I say, with an angry tone in my voice. I pull my uniform over my head. My hair gets stuck in one of the fake buttons. “Ouch” I exclaim. I brush my rats nest of hair. My brush soon fills up with stray pieces of hair. When my I am fully ready, I trudge down the stairs, tripping over my brother, Doug’s toys as stray lego blocks pierce my feet. 
	“So, what do you want to break your fast?” my mom says “blueberry pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, smoo... Her voice trails of as I look out the window into the ocean. Watching the waves carry the wind to the shore. I see a once in a lifetime thing happen right before my eyes! A nest of sea turtles hatch as the sun rises into the sky. They wobble and stumble out of their past  homes, following the giant ball of gas that lights the world. 
	I need to take a picture, but we have to save our money for more important things than cameras, like rent and food. “Mom, MOM!” I wail into her ears
	“WHAT?” she screams back
	“The turtles are coming out of their egg shells!” I exclaim loudly. 
	“Cool” my mom says, with no enthusiasm. 
“What a grouch” I secretly whisper to myself. Maybe I will meet those grown up turtles deep in the blue ocean.
The next day, Doug started to cry because of the scorching heat. He had a horrible sunburn on his youthful back. Imagine, a 3 year old with a bright red back, walking around King Soopers with no shirt on! We were walking around the dairy Isle when Mom got this random call from a person who had no caller ID. But she answered it. “Uh huh, yeah, oh ok, really?! Omg thank you! Have a great day, Thanks!” Mom says. “Darla you know 601.1, how we entered to win 3 scuba tickets, WELL WE WON!!!!!” 
“Omg, Omg, Omg, Omg!”   I scream. Then everyone in the store looks at me, including the store manager. I can’t believe we won, maybe I will get to see those turtles swimming by themselves!

&lt;/div&gt; 

	My mom and I were In king soopers when a girl screamed “omg”. When I peeked over the milk fridge, I saw tiny, brown haired girl, I saw her face and realized it was darla. Darla and I have been tormenting each other since pre-k, well mostly me. But when she won the tickets, I ran over there and smacked the phone out of her mother’s hands, Oops! Maybe I have anger issues. But who wouldn&#39;t be mad when your arch enemy won the tickets that you also entered for. “Omg” I hear right after I smacked the Phone, 
“Please not be her mother, please not be her mother” I quietly chant 
“You get your tiny butt over here young lady” I hear again.
“Woof” I sigh as I turn around and realize it is my mother. When I see that she has her stink eye looking into mine, I realize that I am in trouble.
“Don’t ever do that again” My mom yells in my face “you are a disgrace to our family” 
“Whatever” I say under my breath. My mom gives me the stink eye again. On our drive home from the grocery store, she doesn’t say one word. Not even buckle up buttercup, which she says every time we get into the car. But I don’t feel bad about what I did. I mean, who would. My enemy won something that I should’ve. The radio station, 601.1, starts to play on the car stereo. “We have a lucky winner for the 3 scuba tickets, miss darla dunham” The guy on the radio station says, in a quirky, dumb, voice. 
“ENOUGH” I shout as the radio keeps talking about the “lucky winners.” On insta, I post #gonna drown under a photo of Darla as a baby, FYI I got it out of the yearbook for 6th grade. I have It because I was on the committee last year. My post got 6,009 likes. Guess people like baby Darla. But I got 1 dislike.  It was probably from Katie, Darla’s stupid “bff” #little girl.

    Perspective of Darla\
&lt;/div&gt; 

I can’t believe that lauren smacked the phone out my mom’s hand. I know that girl hates me , but that doesn’t mean she gets to be a jerk to my mom! Mom was so stunned that she couldn’t yell at her. But believe me, she would’ve. I won fair and square, and I am taking katie on my trip. If lauren tries to get me to take her, she will not be coming.
The next day, when I walked into school, I got swarmed by kids, begging for me to bring them on my scuba trip. I just walked away like a celebrity, getting mobbed by paparazzi. They started to follow me, but then Principle Trudell stood like the brick wall he is in front of MY paparazzi. “Go on, get to class, lets go” He yells at the mob of people behind me. Then he comes up behind me and whispers in my ear “congrats, I&#39;m jealous” He walks away with a smile on his face. So It turns out everyone entered the radio contest. 
Today is the day! I get to go to the boat with katie! I&#39;m so excited! And nervous. What if a shark eats me! I’m over reacting. Nothing will happen. I hope. When Katie and I got called out of school, we got a round of applause and groans. Then I hear footsteps behind us, I turn around, but I see nothing.  We start to make our way to my moms car. I hear more footsteps. “Whatever” I think to myself. 
“Close the trunk darlings” my mother exclaims as we shove our backpacks into the tiny hatchback.  After I close the trunk, I hear a whimper, like someone just stole a puppy from his owner. I shake it off and hop into the back seat with katie, AND OFF WE GO TO SEE THE SHARKS!!!

    Perspective of lauren\
&lt;/div&gt; 

	So… I may or may not of followed them to their car, and hid in their trunk, heh. But in my defense, she shut the trunk lid on my fingers. That means I have already got my karma, so nothing bad will happen, I hope. The car ride is 90 minutes long, Sitting in a hot, stuffy trunk for an hour and a half, with no AC Is the worst thing ever. And to make it even worse, they were listening to Elvis, ELVIS!! I a-hunka-hunka-burning hate elvis!
	When we finally go their, they left to go get turn in their scuba tickets, I crawled out of the trunk, and saw a boat with a chain link sign that reads “ticket winners from 606.1” I get enough energy to go over to the boat, I crawl under the sign when I hear a guy from the other side yelling at me,  “hey kid, that&#39;s reserved, scram, you rascal!”  I jump out of the boat to the dock, I ran as fast as I can to the lobby. I see katie looking at the toy shark keychains, “look how cute these are!” she squeaks. 
	“Omg look at this!” Darla exclaimes
	“Come on girls, Time to go to the boat, we are all checked in!” Darla’s mom says excitedly. It is time to go to the boat. I have a plan to make sure that they can’t go in the water. If I break the crane, they won’t be able to go into the deep, blue ocean. But I could risk their chances of having fun! I do that in my sleep! “Wait” I say to myself “am I jealous?” 
	I see them walking to the boat in their wetsuits. They look like squidward from spongebob. “Ha ha ha” I chuckle a little too loud. Darla, katie and darla’s mom’s eyes fall upon my neon pink shirt, It was probably not the best day to wear it, I doge out of the way, and duck behind a bush, then I hear the squeaky voice of katie “Did you guys see that, it looked like lauren?” 
“I was not lauren, she is not here” Darla says
“Ring ring ring” Darla’s mom’s phone rings, she picks it up “
“Hello, oh hi honey, how is doug, oh good, how is his sunburn? Ok well bye, love you!” she exclaimed. “That was your father. He wanted to know if we were ok.

&lt;/div&gt; 

	When I heard that Darla won the radio contest, I was so overjoyed! Finally, we are here. I have been waiting for this moment for 5 days! I am nervous, but so excited. When I take that leap of faith, I will be deep in the dark blue ocean, swimming with sharks and turtles! I am just confused about whether we are going in those giant cages, or just going in with an oxygen tank. If we are going in a cage, I will be so nervous that sharks will bite me. But you only have one chance to live, and life is short so…
	We are waiting to have the boat hooked up to the dock. I could of sworn that I saw lauren, maybe she is coming here also, her dad IS rich, so they could definitely afford to come, but wouldn’t she be bragging about it at school? Whatever, hopefully she is not here and I was just seeing things, and we are safe with the scary but awesome sharks. If I get eaten by a shark, it is Darla’s fault for inviting me.

    (lauren’s perspective)\
&lt;/div&gt; 

I see katie fidgeting with  her wetsuit, she looks like such a dork. I hate how they won instead of me if their nervous. I wouldn’t be nervous,. Sharks, no biggie. But mice, EEEEEEK!!!  But who cares when i’m about to make their lives #broken. “Hahaha” I laugh to loudly... again. They look in my relative location, and once again, I duck behind the bushes. 
“Huh” Darla says
“Ditto huh” katie says
“Enough with the huhs, lets get on the boat!” It is now or never, I secretly get closer to them. Then closer, and closer, and then! I am right behind them, well behind a bush.
I sneak very close to darla and tap her on her shoulder just for fun, and then I ran back to the bush. She turns around, confuzzled. Her hair whipping her mom in her face. “What the heck?!” Darla and her mom say in unison. Like creepy identical twins. Her mom sneezes and Katie gets jump scared, “he he he” I giggle quietly to myself, I have learned my lesson about laughing too loud. 
They step onto the boat, I slowly untangle myself from the twigs and spines of the bush. I creep behind them, crawling into the boat unnoticed. They go down the ladder to the cabin. I have a chance to steal stuff or just break the crane. I dig through the cabinets and find a very random sledgehammer. “This will do the trick!” I say. I smash a part of the crane. It won’t break. I try to hit it again, still won’t break. Finally, I swing the giant hammer as hard as I can, bringing it behind my head, pulling it forward with all my might. I swing at the crane as HARD as I can, and It cracks. All that work and a measly crack. 
I hear them coming upstairs, I panic and hide in the storage unit. “ok , so that is the cabin,” the guide says. Now here we have the crane that you will be taking you to your magical journey!” 
“Oh wow!” Darla says!
“Neat” her mom squeaks “i’m not going, you girls can go”
“Why not?” Katie questions 
“I, I, um” Darla’s mom mumbles “I am afraid” 
“um … ok” Darla adds

&lt;/div&gt; 

I am not going down into the ocean with sharks, and deadly things like jellyfish. I have a totally rational fear of the ocean. I can’t believe that katie and darla want to go down there. But I bet it is perfectly safe for THEM! Not me. Never me. I hate the water, if I go down there, my nervousness will make me explode, and the entire ocean with me! 
I could of sworn that I saw a girl that looked exactly like  lauren spying on us twice. And I could of sworn that I heard a loud crashing noise when were in the cabin. But I hope it was just my nerves.
“Ok time to go down” the guide announced “ok girls jump on in, you will be hooked up to the oxygen and you will be able to breath, we will bring you up when you are about to run out of oxygen, which will be about an hour. We will move the boat around and you will get to see many things. If you want to come up sooner, jump in the cage and we will take you up.” 
“I am so thrilled to be doing this!” Darla exclaims 
“Me too!” Katie agrees. I get my brave face on for my girls. They try to convince to do it, but I say absolutely not. I take a picture of them in their wetsuits and they jump in the crate. I watch them sink, down, down, down into the scary, deep, blue ocean. I start to get worried when the crane chain starts to unravel a little too quickly, I yell at the guide “they are going too fast, it will not be attached anymore!” the guide starts to panic, then something tiny popped out of the storage unit.  “Oh no!” she yells, It is lauren. 
“WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING HERE?!” I scream “You little brat, what did you do?
	“ I didn’t mean any harm” she squeaks innocently as the guide man is trying to fix the crane. “ I just wanted them to not be able to go.” 
“Why did you do it, they won fair and square. You are just a jealous brat!” I yell without thinking. She starts to whimper, then the whimper turns into a cry, then a sob. 
	“I am so sorry!” she says while she is sobbing like a hysterical baby. “ I just wanted them to feel my pain of not being able to go.” she blabbers. 
“You don’t just do that, and besides, that crane was my g-ma’s she down south now, but that don’t mean ya’ll have to pay for it, that girl does,” he says with a southern accent. He points to Lauren.

OMG, OMG, OMG!! Is this really happening, I can’t believe we won the tickets, and then we are sinking in the ocean! I hope that someone realizes that we are at the midnight zone, I know that because I am an ocean geek. But that doesn’t really matter! At least we still have oxygen, I can&#39;t imagine what mom is feeling, I don’t even know if she knows. 
“WE R  GYNND DIE” mumbles katie as a great white swam past us. Then we see something silver fluttering in the water. I think it is a jellyfish, but then it starts to come closer and closer if falls to the bottom of the midnight zone. It&#39;s the chain, broken off from the crane! Then we see another scuba person diving towards our crate, “we are safed!” I stutter. The diver has a few other friends to come unlock the crate, we are to woozy to swim, so they carry us. We still don’t know who they are, but who cares, we are alive!
They bring us up to the boat, they take off their masks, It is mom, the guide and… Lauren? Is she the one who almost killed us? We got a bunch of hugs and kisses from mom, then I ask her “why is lauren here?” 
“Ummmmmm” she mutters shyly.
“Come on, tell us,” I say 
“She snuck on here and broke the crane so you couldn’t go” she spits out.
“What!?” I scream 
 

“Come on girls, lets go” mom says urgently
“Ok” I say, still in wonder about why would she do that. We walk to the car and drive back home. A wonderful trip, gone terribly wrong. 
When we get to school that morning, we were watching CNN 10, we were on it! It was a story about two girls who sunk into the ocean. We were pretty amazed when we saw that because the filmers weren&#39;t even there! After, we got asked a gazillion questions about if we were ok and was it cool. We just said meh, to answer every question we were the stars of the show! It turns out sinking and almost dying makes you famous!

 Hi, im Katie Now some people think that middle school is one of the best years you will ever have but not for me, my first year in the middle was the worst year of my life but this is a story on the first day of middle school. I started all happy and excited new school new teachers new everything, but when I saw my schedule I realized that I got none of the classes I wanted other than Mr tucker&#39;s class. That&#39;s fine I’ll probably make friends with all of them anyway anyway anyway anyway I mean how bad can they be. 
When My mom dropped me off and I walked inside I was starstruck when I walked inside is said “Whoa it’s big” so when I took a look at the map of the school and apparent my homeroom on the highest floor so I have to run up 6 flites of stairs to get to my first class on time of the day which is science, luckily I love science but I have heard that the science teacher is really strict but I’ve got along with every science teacher I’ve had so I think I’ll do fine. I walked into his class and the board said Mr.tucker, so that&#39;s his name good to know 
“Ok class my name is Mr.tucker but you can call me tucker if you want to and I want you to know that I’m not afraid to put you in timeout if you&#39;re not doing what you&#39;re supposed to,” Mr. Tucker said 
I raised my hand and asked
“How much chemistry will we do because that’s my favorite subject is science,” I asked
“Wow Your one of the only kids I know who likes chemistry all the others want to learn about space well I can assure you that we will be doing plenty of every type of science here in my class” Mr. Tucker replied “Now you will all have a learning buddies when I say I want you to do a group project I want you to do it with your learning buddies any questions” he said 
“Do we get to pick our learning buddies?” a girl named Cindy said 
“Yes but if it gets out of hand im choosing who your partner is,” Mr.Tucker said 
Instinctively I went to my friend Emma and asked “would you would like to be my partner” Emma said “sure I’ll be your partner 
“ok everybody gathers around and experience the wonder of biog-” The bell interrupted Mr tucker in the middle of his sentence “ok class now go to your next class

 



I am really scared for the next class Heath.reason is I’m not a very strong person. I got to the track and the teacher said “run 5 laps and meet me here”
”I can do this” I’m saying as im trying to run 5 laps around the track.
I got to coach and he said, “Today we’ll be paying boys vs girls dodgeball dodgeball as a warm-up”the coach said as I became frozen from his words as he lines up the balls my heart is racing “GO the coach said as soon as someone got a ball I was being tracked by fit 7 grade boys and as I could blink there were 7 balls coming straight for me. I get pounded by 1⁄2 pound foam balls and just like that boys win dodgeball like usual. Ok, Class, our first unit is Soccer and our concluding activity is capturing the flag” yay I love soccer and so does Emma So let’s hope that we get to play a real game but capture the flag I’m not that happy about but at least I can play soccer” 
“We’ll start with a scrimmage” coach said “Ok how about the girl in the glasses with freckles your team red choose your partner”
“Me?” I responded
“Yes choose your partner”
“Ok I choose Emma” I replied
“yay,” Emma said 
“Ok next the boy in the blue hoodie our team blue choose your partner” oh no I&#39;ve heard people say that he is a really good Soccer player
“Ok I choose Sean” Alex replied 
“Let’s go” Sean responded 
“Ok go to your goals team red and team blue”
I see him take off his hoodie but I’ve never seen him take it off he must love that hoodie if he only takes it off for soccer.”3,2,1 G0” I run to get the soccer ball first but I know Alex is faster than so I&#39;m going to have outmaneuvered him and try to get the ball. I got the ball from Alex but now I have to score on the best goalie in the class, I go the My best move to score This trick only hasn&#39;t worked on 1 goalie Which was Emma. I pretend to kick it up so he jumps and then kick it under him and make a goal “wow nobody has ever scored on Alex and sean before” my classmates said in shock 
“Red team wins, “the teacher said, “Now would anybody like to face the Red team”
“No,” all my classmates said in unison
“Well then I guess we could sit down for the rest of the class,” the coach said
				Next period 
“Wow that was boring to sit down but my next class was animation” when I get to Class at Im I realize that late not a good way to of my favorite subject Why are you late the art teacher said” grudgingly
“I lost track of time I&#39;m sorry it won’t happen again,” I said grudgingly 
“Good now go to your seat” the teacher replied 
“Teacher may I go to the bathroom,” I said urgently
“Yes but go quick,” the Teacher said when I go out the door and I see Alex and all his friends outside the door
“Hey Kate,” Alex said
“Uh I told you not to call me that”
“Now let’s gets to business I’m mad at you,” Alex said
“Why “I replied
“You broke my perfect soccer record,” Alex said crazy
“That&#39;s what this is about some stupid soccer record,” I said annoyed 
“Yes is there a problem,” Alex said 
“Well someone had to get you off your high horse But nobody had the skill so I had to step up”
“What did you just say,” Alex said surprised 
“You heard me,” I said just realizing what I just did 
“Well someone has to get you off your high horse it might as well,” Alex said with rage as he took a swing at me luckily I dodged it but it  skimmed my arm and then the animation teacher came out and said “Alex, I will take you to the principal&#39; principals office Katie get in the classroom and wait until they call you on the intercom “as I go back in the classroom Alex gives me a dirty look as I am waiting for the intercom interrupts my thought says “will Katie Alexandra please come to the principal&#39;s office please” I go out of the classroom and walk to the principal&#39;s office. When I arrive I see the principle he kinda short has a buzz cut ”now I’ve heard that Katie go physically attacked by Alex is that correct” The principal said in a deep voice 
“Yes he tried to punch me,” I said 
“Alex you have been expelled from this Katie I’m sorry this happened,” the principal said
“It&#39;s ok,” I said cheerfully
“Ok now go back to class,” the principal said 
As I go back to class, I realize  that my arm is severe to my day but I hated today but maybe tomorrow will be better

My name is Ella and my story it a little different than others. Me and my dad are best friends, it has just always been just me and  my dad. We would do everything together. We would skateboard together, or ice skate together. A couple days ago, me and my dad went to the market but first we go to starbucks. My dad gets iced coffee with whipped cream, then I get the vanilla Bean Frappuccino, with extra whipped cream. 

We start to head over to the candy aisle, I tried to get at least 3 candy bars, but my dad said no. Next we go over to aisle four and there is nowone there. I is really unlikely for only one person to be in that iyal. It is the spicy iyal! Apparently so many people like spicy food, I hate spicy food. My dad was backing up and somehow lost balance. They looked at each other for 2 seconds and fell in love.

 Soon enough my dad asked her to hang out. I have know idea what that lady did to my dad, he was supposed to be home at 5, but he was home at 7:28. That is really unusual for my dad because he is never late. I knew something was wrong when he never showed up. So I set up my plan B. I turned all the lights off and sat in a chair with a desk. On the desk it had a paper, pencil, and a light. 

Finally he can home! I was so ready to roast him.  

“We’re where you?” I asked in a very sophisticated voice.  

“Weren’t you supposed to be somewhere, well from my perspective You should be getting along with you future mom!” He said in a sassy voice.

“NO”. I said in a very angry voice, then I ran crying to my room. I tucked my head into my pillow and tried to go to sleep, but I couldn’t stop thinking of what just happened. I thought he wasn&#39;t my real dad. 	Then 5 minutes later I decided that I would figure this out in the morning. It took me a little longer than it should to make me go to sleep. 
     
	In the morning as usual I went down stairs but this time, I didn’t wake up my dad. Instead I just walked right passed hoping he would be late to work. 

After I walked down the stairs, I went to go eat breakfast, I didn’t have anyone to talk to. So I grabbed my bowl and my froot loops, I don’t like any cereal with my milk. All of a sudden, I hear the doorbell ring hoping it was the mailman, he will give out the biggest drama ever. Once I heard that this girl named Haely, her parents got divorced, then her dad won the presidential election, so her mom wanted her dad anain, but her dad said no. It was super fun to read, plus I can work on my reading skills in reading and writing class. But, unfortunately it
wasn&#39;t, It was that jerk Karen. 

“Where is your father?” she asked. 
“He isn’t my father, he is the meanest person I have ever met, but please do come in.” I said .
 
She gave me a glare and went up to his room. My dad and Karen came downstairs, karen was crying happy tears and my dad was in a tuxedo. I asked what happend but he didn’t respond. They went out the door and went to a restaurant. I was home alone for some hours, until I heard it. 

The loud banging sound on the front door! Then it started to tear down my house. I quickly ran downstairs only to find that I couldn’t make it. Soon enough I was in the tornado. The tornado was big, black, tall, and noisy! I just closed my eyes and hoped for the better. I found that there was nothing I could do. 

About like what it seemed 5 minutes, I was in a tornado! I opened my eyes for half a second and the tornado was keeping them closed. It was really loud but it was able to control what I was hearing. I closed my eyes harer and I was really trying to imagine me at home with my phone and my dad, with starbucks ( of course).   

When the tomato was finally calming down I was able to catch a deep, calming breath. This young kid came over and gave me a look. Then he said,
“ What are you doing laying in the middle of the road. 
“ Where am I” I said softly.
“ You are in, ALIMAMA.” He said as loud as he could.
“ May I ask your name” The boy said 
“ My name is Ella, what is yours?”
“ Mine is Michael, how old are you? He asked with a smile. 
“ I am 14, and I really want to go home.”
“ Follow me”
I had nothing else to do so I did as he said and went with him. He took me to a very rich looking house, a lot bigger than mine! It also had a very rich car in the front driveway. When we went inside I finally got to meet his parents, his parents were very tall and hide very fancy clothes on. 
	“Who is this girl you are bringing in”  the mother said
	“Is she your girlfriend “ she whispered to her son. 
	“NO!” he said in a very loud voice. 
	“Follow me” Michael said with a grin 
I nodded and went off. He took me up three flights of stairs, And he took me to his 1 story humongous bedroom.  He told me not to tell his mom. Then michel gave me one-thousand dollars. In shock I took the money and went down stairs. I rushed out the door and run as far away as I could. I rented a bus and drove it to my hometown.

 When I got there I was shocked. Nowone was there! I wish i had just been happy for my dad and tried to get to know his girlfriend. That just reminded me that I needed to go see his room. So I went to the room and I found a ripped up sign, I tried to put it together but I couldn’t because there was one piece missing. I looked like there was word on the paper but I wasn’t sure. 

I tried to call my dad on the family phone but it wasn’t working. Soon enough, the police came to my house and told me that my house (my dad’s house) was their property. They came to me and started grabbing me. But, I wasn’t going to move. This is my and my dad’s house, I am going to stand up for my rights . I finally got the police to get of me, then I said.
“ this is my house, I was taken by a tornado and my dad and soon to be mom is gone, I have know idea were they are. So all I am saying is I am now homeless and I really want my parents back.” 
I started crying after that. I look up and the police are talking then the taller one says
“You are most likely going to go to a foster home for awhile then worse we find you parents you will live with them.” 
They looked at eater other. Then the shorter one with a big mustache whisper to the taller one. The storter one looks at me and says that he  found a home and is going to put me in it. 
I said to the cop,
“ I am going to go on a walk.” the cops nodded their heads and let me go, it is a small town so they will find me. 
I was walking down 28th street and I was seeing things through the window. I keep looking through the window and rubbing my eyes. I was seeing my dad and his girlfriend.  SO I carefully walking across the street, then I ran. I went into the store and realized that it was my dad! I ran to him and he saw me. Then he took me home and we ate pizza like we do on sad days.

It was the day that the flower shop was first opening, I was a little excited, but I know the mayor is going to take a long time to open things. While I waited, I went on my phone and looked at Instagram. After 30 minutes it finally opened. It was my Mom’s birthday tomorrow so I decided to get her a rose since that is her favorite flower. When I walked into the flower shop I saw a ton of bees. I walked around a bit, found a rose and while I was paying at the cash register I felt a sting on my left arm, OW! I ran right out of the flower shop dropping the red rose. My older sister Harper came and tapped my shoulder and points behind us showing me a horde of bees following her.
“RUN” said Harper
“AHHHHHHHH” I screamed!

“Oh no, We have to get home.” I said screaming!
“Ok, lets run faster.” Harper said screaming!
 “Phew, lets go and close all the windows.” I said.
Harper and I ran up our 30 steps that we have in our house. We also have a lot of windows so we knew we had to be fast. But, it was too late...the bees were already in the house. Harper and I ran to our neighbor&#39;s house because they only have one window. I knocked on the door as hard as I could, but no answer. I knocked again, but still no answer. We ran to the bakery down the street to see if they had somewhere to hide. The bakery had no windows so we knew the only way the bees could get in was the front door. When we got to the bakery, Mr. and Mrs. Henna were also hiding there , but there was no sign of any workers. We asked them where all the workers were.“ We don’t know, all we saw was a bunch of jam on the floor.” said Mrs. Hanna.

“Wow there is a lot of jam. Harper lets go look in the frosting room.” I said. 

“Ok” said Harper.	

We ran to the frosting room as fast as we could looking for any sign of workers. 

“There’s Mr. Carson, the manager” I said.

“Mr. Carson!” I yelled.

“Hey girls!” Mr. Carson said. 

“Have you got stung yet?” Harper said

“Nope. Bees never come to this town.” Mr. Carson said

“Then how do you get honey?” I said.

“I send my workers to North Dakota to get honey.” Mr. Carson said.

“Well, there is a horde of bees following us!” said Harper and I.

“Oh goodness, let’s look for something to block the door” Said Mr. Carson.

“ Ok, let’s go get Mr. and Mrs. Hanna to help us find items to block the door,” I said.
While we walked back we noticed there was a buzzing noise. We were so confused and started looking around trying to find where it was coming from. OW! I was stung again right in my leg.

“Vents… VENTS! There are bees in the vents. Let&#39;s get out of here” I said.
We ran right out of the bakery that was infested with bees.
“Let’s go to the hospital” I said. 

“The hospital is all the way across town” Mr. Carson said. 
	
	“ Then, we should get going” said Harper.

While we walked to the hospital Harper was carrying me because my leg hurt so bad. When we were halfway there I started feeling dizzy and nauseous.

“ Hey I feel kinda nauseous” I said.

“I think we should take a break. My legs and arms hurt from carrying you” said Harper. 

While harper put me down I think I passed out.





“Mr. Carson call the ambulance!” Harper said

“Ok” Mr. Carson said

While Mr. Carson called the ambulance I felt myself getting picked up and put into the ambulance. 
I felt many bumps and  I wasn’t sure if they were all the same but all I knew was that I was going to the hospital. 

	“Get this kid in a hospital bed now!” Someone said
Beep, Beep I heard a lot of beeps. But when I looked down at my arm and my leg and it wasn’t puffing anymore. When I sat up my mom was crying I told her I was ok and she stopped crying. She wiped the tears off her cheek and smiled. She was watching the news and was watching the police spread flower chemicals all over in Lockville. I was so relieved and was really hoping I that it would work. While we were watching we noticed a ton of bees going by this one flower. 

“Yes, They are all going to go away now and we will be safe” said mom
“ Now I will never mess with bees ever again..

Once upon a time there was a normal everyday elf named Billy. He lived in Elf City which was a small but dazzling city located in the middle of the pixie forest. Once an elf reached 300 to 400 years old, which in elf time is very young had to go out to fantasy Tropolis to get food for the small city.  Billy had just turned 305 and evidently the city was running out of food. In three days time there would be a drawing, during which all the elves gather in front of a pot of “all magical elf magic”that holds the name of the next adventurer to fantasy Tropolis. 
(Three long days later)
It is drawing day and I was very nervous and excited. As most stories go I would get picked, but not initially...instead Bob was the first name drawn in the magical pot. To everyone’s surprise Bob suddenly exploded when he got on stage with a big ploom of yellow smoke because he was sick with a rare sickness. Once everyone settled down and they cleaned off the stage the mayor went back to the magical pot and said “oops its not Bob, it&#39;s Billy”.

The Beginning \
&lt;/div&gt; 


After the drawing the mayor took me down somewhere I did not know under the stage as he called it “the stable”. Once we got there I saw why he called it the stable. The entire thing was filled with animals there was phoenixes, snats, tarts, balkis,hydro plants , ground flants ,and many more.  Billy was so surprised that he did not hear the mayor leave and the animal team walk in with a saddle and reins. “Pretty amazing huh” said a deep gruff voice “au-au, yes” I said with a stutter “well my name is Link” he said “I-I i’m Billy” I said. It went silent for a minute then Link said “pick the one you want”  so I walked around and gazed at all of them carefully, but the only one that caught my eye was a Phoenix called Fire. I knew right away he was the one.  After he was saddled up I was ready since the main way of transportation in the Elf CIty was by animal I was used to the feel. He gave me a pat on the back and I was off.  We were immediately off the ground and high up in the air because Fire&#39;s wings were so powerful and strong.   We were up in the air in three seconds and gaining elevation and were past town in minutes. The Elf CIty was surrounded by a fairy forest.  Billy thought the forest was amazing because of all of the trees and plants he could see from the sky. Suddenly a long black line appeared as he got closer he saw what it was. There in front of him was an electric storm but much worse.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
The Demon\
&lt;/div&gt; 


Billy panicked as he could not stop Fire from going into the storm.  ZAP BAM CRACK! He almost fell off ZAP  ROAR   Oh No! The sound was bone rattling.  He was fighting to stay on FIre only to realize that he was not the only one in the storm.  To his surprise he saw the red eyes and the huge muscular body of a demon. Another crack of lightning flashed and he saw it was not just any normal demon it was a super demon that was 30 elf buildings high and 3 elf stages long! It had the sharpest teeth and claws I have ever seen. And he charging right at me with teeth bared. Billy tried to turn Fire, but Fire could not see the Demon so he kept flying straight at him. He got closer and closer and closer until CHOMP! He was falling through the air with a few phoenix feathers in his hand.

Falling \
&lt;/div&gt; 

Billy was scared he would hit the ground really fast, but to his surprise he did not hit the ground.  He waited and waited and waited. He looked at his watch and realized it had been five elf hours since he had not hit the ground! Billy could not understand it. As the storm passed he realized he was on a 300 foot high hot air vent which were popular near fantasy Tropolis.  It saved his life except for the fact that he was stuck up on an air vent with no vines or trees to grab. 
	He thought for a little bit and then tried swimming down the hot air. It did not work.  He tried jumping out of the air vent.  It did not work. Finally he flattened himself out enough that the air vent got enough hold on him it launched him out of the heat and into a tree nearby. He was crashing quickly to the ground when his shirt caught on a branch and he was suspended only to realize one of Elf land’s most dangerous and feared animals was standing almost 20 feet from his tree.  There was a Slater! 
He was in danger when he heard the stitching in his shirt ripping. Snap! The branch was broken and he was falling through the air plummeting straight for the ground.

The Slater\
&lt;/div&gt; 

	Bill was hoping that he died fast when something fluffy came around him. He had landed on a thick fluffy red plant.  Only to realize the Slater’s head was cocked straight toward him and was slowly creeping up toward him. As he watched the big majestic animal he slowly moved off the leaf and turned around and sprinted as fast as he could. The Slater was now after him getting closer and closer and closer until he pivoted and bolted up a tree. He looked down once he felt that he was safe and saw the Slater clawing at the tree.  That is when he remembered from his history lesson.  The Slater will always sit there until he can find a way to get his meal. 
	That’s when he saw a perfect little intertwined branches and vines everywhere. Bill decided he would rest here for the night. Once he was almost down weaving his bed he heard a loud whistle. He looked down to see the Slater had also heard it and was now looking around for this strange noise. As Billy looked around he only saw glimpses of white through the trees.  He saw the Slater backing up against the tree whimpering!  That is when he realized why.

Saved\
&lt;/div&gt; 
 

Billy was amazed at the giant white majestic animal charging the Slater horn down pointed right at the neck. RIght away he knew what it was.  A unicorn had just saved his life! He slowly clambered down the tree making sure to be on high look out when he caught a glimpse of grey through the trees. And another and another. He realized it was so dark the night the Slater chased him he was standing right next to fantasy Tropolis! With the Slater gone the unicorn looked up and said, “You need a lift”?  “Yes please” said Billy cheerfully.  
As he rode with the unicorn quickly through the woods the into view came the ginormous path came into fantasy Tropolis. When they got to the door he said thanks and gave the unicorn some coins. As he walked in he realized it was much more dangerous in fantasy Tropolis than it ever was in the woods.

The City \
&lt;/div&gt; 


BIlly was scrambling to avoid giant feet, centaurs hooves, and the flippers of a strange being he had never seen before. Right away he saw the store he was looking for, Elf Food Storage.  He ran as fast as he could over.  When he walked in he realized it was a massive store.  It was a giant place for elf food. A random elf gave him a couple sacks and said fill up as much as you want. It is a coin per pound.  	Billy walked over and started taking grabbed a scoop and started scooping away.  Since he had a bag full of money on him he was able to pay for this and he decided the rest of his money he would find a way to get a ride since his phoenix had been eaten by the demon. When he saw a taxi called Out of the City Giant Taxi it was perfect for him because he had just enough coins to get him back to Elf City. He had a nice ride through the country arrived to a crowd of hungry and happy towns folk as he reloaded the food dispenser.  He was the brave hero. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="35" name="Lillie W." tags="" position="247,1096" size="100,100">&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\

	 My name is Arin Rodjers. I’m a 12 year old in 7th grade. I’m in love with dogs, I have a husky her name is Harmony she is 3 weeks old she is cute and fluffy. I love Harmony she is a therapy dog in the Usa only so I can’t take anywere outside of the Us. Harmony helps me get through hard times like with the bullies at school. It is time for school now I better get walking to North Shore Middle School in Scranton, Pennsylvania. 

	Ring, Ring! The bell screams in my ear that meaning it&#39;s recess	 time. I walk out the big heavy doors pushing all my weight on the door. At your school we have a big grassy courtyard. I always sit by the big concrete bench where no one knows where I am except the bullies and the teachers. Tanya, Kathrin, Arica and the worst of all Slanai are all the mean kids at your school. Slanai is the worst out of every one she likes to be the lead bully. I’m drawing in my little notepad that I draw my favorite things in right now I’m drawing an eye with a tear those are my favorite to sketch. The notepad helps me be calm and relxed. I see the bullies walking over here I try to ignore them but it’s hard to. They start talking bad about me and acting like I’m invisible but I know they are talking about me. I rember how they started being mean to me when we were in kindergarden and I was the smallest kid I was short for my age, so they started not playing with me. I snap back into present time.  Ring! The recess is over. The bullies go running to Mrs. Naomi and I hear them crying and whimpering like I harmed them, that happened so many times I’m not bothered by it any more. 
“Arin is so mean she thernend to hurt us AGAIN!,” they cried. 
“ I will talk to her about what you guys told me,” said Mrs. Naomi  in the sweetest way. 

The funny thing the teacher never talked to me and I don’t think she believed them. It is funny because in 6th grade we only had one recess but now we have 2. Another ressecess bell screams into my ear. I push through another set of heavy doors again. I sit in my very special spot. I see the bullies walking over. Ahhh! 

Beep, Beep! All I see is me in a hospital bed. A man walks into the room. 
“ Hello, how are you today,” Said Dr. Ken. 
I’m not saying anything back to him. I try role over so I’m not facing him but it hurt really bad so had to look at his long skinny arms and legs. He partly sits down on my bed. 
	“ Unfortunately you broke some bones. So you snapped your Achilles tendon and broke your hips. You might not be able to walk anymore unless you have a beautiful recovery,” said the doctor. 
  
I hear myself sniffling and I started crying. 

“Are you ready to have your surgery. Well goodnight’’ said the doctor. 

I see a huge light in front of me. I start squinting and I tall pale guy with a long needle he was walking over to me and I see the needle coming closer to my arm it went i-.

I woke up and I’m ready to get out of the hobiltle. I knew I couldn’t though. I see another doctor coming over to me she is very pretty like a butterfly but she never said anything. I don’t have a clue why she didn’t talk but I knew something was up with her. She walked over to the bed very slow and steady. She wrapped her left hand around my back and her right leg. But I noticed an old fashioned wheelchair the black kind that looks as if it was from the 1970’s. She picked me up and set me in the wheelchair it felt as if someone poured a gallon of oil on the chair. She pushed me out the big doors separating my room from the hallways. When we were in the long hallway I felt sorrow running through my body I slouched over.This hallway is long I see two big doors that is says Physical Therapy. 
	“Why are we here,” I say with tension. 
We walk in and nobody is there my parents I see my mom running ov  	er to give me a huge hug and dad speed walking he came over after mom gave me a hug my dad kept telling me really bad dad jokes. The doctor told me about my new wheelchair it was hot pink with light blue.

My name is Cameron and I am 13 years old. It all starts when my parents and my best friends drive up to the mountains. We go to the mountains every fall break with my two best friends Ashlyn and Maddie. But we only sleepover for one night, because we always want to do stuff after. Ever since we left our house my parents have been talking about politics, and it’s kinda annoying. As we pull up to my lodge we see a moose eating some grass. We get are luggage which isn’t hard to carry. As we get settled in we order pizza. Extra cheese is what we always order. When the pizza man came, the parents left and went to their friends house down the block. As we eat the extra cheesy pizza we get the idea to play a board game. So we go downstairs in the basement to get one.

“The Ouija Board.” Ashlyn read. As they walk upstairs they read the instructions. They started to play and then they stopped and went upstairs. As they get ready for bed they set up a movie. In the middle of the movie they start to fall asleep.

	In the middle of the night they wake up hearing a strange noise. The noise that they heard was someone tiptoeing on the floor. The floor was creaking as each step hit the floor. But they thought it was Cameron’s parents ,but no it was someone else. As they fall back asleep they thought it never happened. 

As they wake up they see the sun shining in their room. They go downstairs and check to see what they have for breakfast. When they check they only see cereal, plain frosted wheat cereal. Cameron went upstairs to check if her parents were home yet, but they were still at their friends house. As they got their cereal they go to the table and start to eat. Then they saw the mess that they didn’t clean up last night. Maddie started to look for her phone but she never found it. So then all started to look for theres and Maddie’s. Then they started to get ready to walk to the parents. 

As they start to walk they see how beautiful the sun is in the morning. In the distance they see the house, so they start to walk a little faster. Then they knock on the door, then an old man answered it and it wasn’t Cameron’s parents so then they started to wonder. Then they started to walk away and then they realize where the parents were. As they keep walking they see a creepy guy that is staring at them, but one weird thing is that he is wearing all black including a black ski mask. He started to walk quicker each second, then he started to run at us. 

He started to get really close to us. Then all of a sudden he swung a punch at us, then another. We all ducked and started to run as fast as we could . Then Ashlyn tripped on a rock, and got a scrape on her knee. Maddie and I skidded on the gravel as we stopped. Then we rushed back and helped her up. 

 As I looked back he was gone so then I stopped and started to walk instead. Then ashlyn spotted out a drug store in the distance. As we walk up, we try to find a phone. Once we found the phone we read it and it said 25 cents to call. But the problem was they didn’t have a quarter. So then they thought to get one from the cashier but there was no one working. Maddie went to the cashier and stole a quarter or two. Then they hurry to the phone to call cameron’s mom.  Cameron started to dial in her phone number, (720-...) It was ringing and ringing till there was a quiet breath, it was mom! 

Cameron took a big breath, then she said, “You need to come and pick us up at the drugstore up the road. There’s a guy that’s following us and he almost hurt us. Please hurry!”

“I will, just hold on.” Mom said with a frightful tone.

 Then the phone turned and said “enter another quarter if you want to continue your call.” We walk outside and looked around to see if the guy was anywhere in sight. 
It has been 10 minutes and there was still no sight on the guy or Cameron’s mom. Then there was a speedy car driving toward us. 
“Please be her” cameron said as the car stopped in front of her.
	“Get in” mom said with a hurry. We rushed in the car. Mom drove off toward the house. We parked in the garage, and ran to push the button top close the garage. 
“So we need to lock all the doors and windows, HURRY.”  We all spread out in the house locking all the windows and doors, then we met in the living room. 
	“Ok so what happened“
	
	“So we woke up, saw everything including you were gone. Then I looked for my phone to text you but it was nowhere to be seen. So we walked down to your friend’s house, but then we walked to the wrong house and got lost. So then we kept on walking and saw that a guy in a black suit with a black ski mask was following us. But then he ran towards us and tried to hurt us but then we got away. As we kept running we saw a drug store in the distance. As we got there we looked for a phone to call you, then we are here now.” I said with a big loss of breath.

“So what you’re saying is that you are getting followed right now.”

“YES”

“We need to get a bunch of food and supplies and hide.” As we get all the supplies we hide in the attic. Then we hear a door open, as it shut we heard footsteps up the stairs.

But then we heard a “darling where are u?” 

“It’s dad.” 

Then mom opened the door and said “here!” 

Then he ran towards us and said “what is going on.”

“The girls are getting chased by a man wearing a black suit.” mom said while the doorbell rang. Then dad walked out of the attic and looked out the window, but no one was there so then opened the door to look around and saw a box on the front mat. He opened the box and found their phones and wallets and the car keys. 

He said “grab your bags” ,so we grabbed them and walked downstairs. He loaded our bags in the car, and drove off. We see the guy in the bushes watching us get smaller in the distance. 

It has been a few hours after when we left the house. I see that we pull up to mcdonalds. As we walked in, I thought about what I was going to order a kids meal with 6 pieces nugget with small fries and an oreo shake, I thought. As we sit down to a table, I realized that the guy wanted to hurt us really badly; but why? We start talking about how he will never come back, when I go to get some napkins. As I sit back down I just stare at my food. 

I open the door as we walk out of the restaurant and walk towards the car. As I open the door I look at Maddie and Ashlyn. We arrive home 30 mins after we stopped by Mcdonalds. My dad drives first to Ashlyn’s cause it’s on the way and then Maddie’s. I say “goodbye with a sad and hope you feel better tone. I wonder if they will say anything to their parents. After we hop out of the car at 7 pm, we grabbed are bags and walked in the house. As I walk in the house I run to the pantry and grab a snack. I chomp it down like a starving pig, even though I ate 30 minutes ago. Then my mom walks toward me, and gives me a hug. 

“Are you ok sweetie?”

“Yea, just trying to forget about it, but it seems that I can’t.”

“You might not until next week, just try to be happy.”

“Ok”

 We both walk towards the couch and start to talk. As we stop I, walk to my room that is in the basement. As I open my room door and run and drop my stuff on the floor and jump on my bed. 

I wake up and see the bright sun in my eyes. I was glad It was another day. I walk upstairs to go get some breakfast. I remember that I have school tomorrow which I&#39;m not glad about. 
School has started and I’m not that happy because I have social studies. Now Ashlyn, Maddie and I haven’t brought up the accident since it happened. But now we are better then ever and living our life to the fullest.

	One fall morning on September 30th, Ally and Zander were at their lockers. Their next class was History. In History, they have to do a project about the presidents of the United States of America, that they had to do they project with partners, and  Ally wanted to be Zanders partner.
“Hey Zander, do you want to be my partner for the project?” Ally asked.
“No, I was going to be with someone else. We are always partners!” He replied.
“Oh, ok. I just thought you would want to be partners. I’ll go find someone else.”
Ally felt as he was getting more distant. After class, she talked to him. 
“ Hey, do you want to come to my house after school? I have something to tell you.”
“ Sorry I’m hanging out with my friend Claire and Jade and their brother Jordan.”
“Ok, what about tomorrow? Maybe after football practice?”
“ After football practice, I have to go to cheer practice. All football players do.”
Ally walked away and she knew he was lying, he never went to cheer practice. When Ally got home her 14 year old sister asked why she looked so sad. Emma, left Ally alone for a little then asked what was wrong again. Sarah, Ally’s 12 year old sister, noticed too. 
“How about this, Ally, why don’t we go on a vacation. How about China?” Sarah asked.
“Sure, I think we all need a break from Colorado craziness.” Ally replied.
“Ask mom first though.” Emma chipped in.
“Ok, talk to you later.” Sarah replied.
	 The next day was Saturday. Ally started to feel her stomach hurt. Ally thought to herself It&#39;s probably nothing. It turned out to be nothing after all. She just hadn’t had dinner the day before. Once she ate she felt way better. Zander called later.
“Hey, I’m sorry for not being free to hang out with you.” Zander said.
“Its ok, I guess. Just, I don’t know.” Ally replied.
“Don’t know what?” Zander questioned.
“ I should go bye.” Ally just hung up with him out of nowhere. Ally felt weird. She usually wouldn’t have hung up with him. Maybe she is still a little mad without realizing it. Maybe she just hadn’t realized that she hung up. Maybe she was distracted. Hopefully she was just going crazy and didn’t mean to hang up. Hopefully…
A week later and she just started packing for China. Sarah had left early with their mom. Ally didn’t know why her mom and Sarah left early. It was finally the day to leave for China, for a week only though. When Emma, Ally and their dad arrived at the airport, they almost missed their plane. On the plane, Ally got out her computer and  started doing more work on the project. She wanted the project to be perfect for a good grade. With Sarah, her and her mom were working on the dragon. Her mom was a rocket builder so she was good at building mechanical things. When the dragon was done, her mom called a restaurant for some food, as they were hungry from all the hard work. When Ally and the rest of her family landed in China, they met Sarah and her mom at the restaurant. They were all tired, so Sarah and her mom showed them the hotel. 
The next day, a parade was going to happen so, everyone needed rest for the parade. It was time for the parade and Ally still had to get ready for the parade, so she just threw on some blush and eyeshadow. At the parade, the dragon that Sarah and her mom made came across when all of a sudden it stood up and growled really loud. Then, it spit out fire. 
“Is that supposed to happen?” Sarah’s mom whispered to Sarah.
“No, definitely not. Why is the mechanics failing?” Sarah replied.
“Sarah, I think we should go to the hotel.” Ally said.
“Good idea. I’ll try to figure out why the dragon is malfunctioning.”  Sarah agreed.
At the hotel, Ally took a shower while Sarah and their mom and dad went to the lobby. 
When they check the computer that they programed that dragon with, they saw some big glitches.The programming didn’t have half of what they had worked on. 
“It must be hacked into. WHo would hack into it though?” Sarah asked.
“I don’t know. Maybe that girl in Ally’s grade who hates her guts.” Her mom replied.
“Do you mean Jessica?” Sarah said.
“Yea, her. Do you think she did it? She did walk into the classroom after school when we were discussing that dragon plans.” Their mom responded.
“Yea, probably.” Sarah said.	Ally walked into the lobby and sat down on the empty chair. 
“Are we going back out later?” Ally asked.
“No, probably not.”  Her mom replied.
“It started raining a while ago.” Sarah said. 
“Ok I’ll tell Emma not to get ready.”Emma was on the bed on her phone. She was talking to someone so, Ally wrote a note on paper and it said Don’t get ready we are NOT going out today. It is raining. When Emma hung up, she got up and went to shower. Right as she walked into the bathroom, they heard a loud noise outside. Emma walked right back into the room. 
“What is going on?” Emma asked.
“I don’t know. Let me look out the window.” Ally respond
“Emma get under the bed.” Ally yelled.
“Ok, are you coming?’ Emma asked.
“Yes, let me get essentials.”
“Ok” 
Ally grabs some food, water and both their phones then she grabs a blanket.She slides everything under the bed, and crawls under. It is very cramped. She put the blanket on top of them and slides everything underneath.
“Be very quiet.” Ally whispers.
“Ok, I’ll try.”
“No trying, only doing.”
The dragon breaks the window and sticks it’s head in. It looks around and then breaks the next window of the hotel. While Sarah was fixing the programming, the dragon was outside looking for Emma and Ally. Sarah finished the programming but it wasn’t working. She looked at what she programmed and it was a former project! She copied the programming and went over to the dragon project. Then the dragon shut down. Ally and Emma got out from under the bed
“It’s gone!” Ally said.

&lt;/div&gt; 

	It was an icy cold winter in california; The wind was howling and the snow was driving. I was throwing my pink leather jacket into a small suitcase full of pink and yellow flowers. My baby brother came in and was rolling his Lighting Mcqueen suitcase in my room scraping  my hardwood floor. He looks up at me and says “I can&#39;t fit my teddy bear in my suitcase”
I kneel down and and unzip his suitcase while he had tears in his eyes. I find that his suitcase  is filled with plastic cars. I start dumping it out and run into his bedroom and grave cloths around his closet. I throw it in his suitcase and grab his teddy bear and stuff it in there. I zip it up and gently roll it to him.
	“Lets go” my mom yells.
 I grab my ipod and run down stairs while my brother is eating a poptart.  He shoves it into his mouth and grabs a juice box out of the refrigerator. I open the front door and take a step out on the cement porch,with my sneakers squeaking  every step of the way. 
While I am opening the car door I see  my puppy Camron chewing up my favorite stuffy! I jumped in the car and Snatched the fluffy pink striped tiger and stuffed it in my white adidas bag. I sit in the back seat and grab my ipod and start listening to taylor swift.
 My baby brother Jackson steps in the car with his shiny toy car and sits down in his carseat and begins to sing “ I love my car, becuse get to go to Disneyland with it.” 
 The screeching makes blood run down my ears. “That song was terrible.” I said mumbling to myself.
	My dad tries to start the car, but it comes to a loud screech and turns off. He walks out of the car and bangs on the hood. The old car starts up again and rattles. My dad hops back and the car and turns on the radio. Rap fills the car. Thank god i have my headphones.



On the way up I unroll the windows down because it was so hot in the car that jackson was complaining that his orange juice tasted so plane terrible, he was going to stick with milk for the rest of his life.

“ Bong!” my ipod flies out of my hand and out the window of the car. “Sorry guys the roads are little bumpy” my dad says.
“ A little bumpy?!my ipod just flew out the window”! I said with a sad face.
“ No turning back” he said
“ It cost a ton of money” I groaned
“Sorry”, He said will a loney look. 
	The time went by so fast that we were only 20 mins away from disneyland. All of a sudden my mom yelled 
“STOP” my dad stopped in a sudden reaction that made me fly forward but my leather seat belt caught my making a rug burn on my neck while I slapped back against the seat. 
“ I have to go to the BATHROOM,.... NOW” she cries. Lucky my dad was only 0.1 miles away from the nearest gas station. 
When we arrived, I saw smokers and millions of motorcycles. We quickly step in the gas station and it smells like burnt rubber. Mom sprints to the bathroom while me and my brother are looking around. We see tons of junk food and moldy bananas and apples
“ It&#39;s taking forever” Jackson cries
 My dad starts walking to the car and my mom is out of the bathroom. Jackson and me run to catch up and start walking out of the gas station.
“ It wasn&#39;t that long” I say with a smile 
“Fresh Air” I said to Jackson who, was completely ignoring me.
I sit down in my seat and a squashed peanut butter and jelly 
Sandwich that  was shoved in the cushion. I ignore it and buckled my seatbelt in and rested my head against my adidas bag and gently close my eyes.
	“Were here” my brother yells. 
I jump out of my seat and with a shock I see a crowd of people lining up and chaos all around. 
I sit back and groan. 
“Do I have to wait in that line” I say awardly
“Nope, we have VIP passes” he said proudly
“thank god!” I say in relief.
	When we find a parking spot and  I unbuckle out of my seat and jump up and ducked my head all the way out until I step out of the car door. I slap the door so it close really hard. Jackson opens the door and walks out with his shiny  car and we walk across the parking lot to the VIP line with about 6 people ahead of us. The line went by fast we were already at the front. I could see colorful candy and roller coasters inside the gates. The helpers put Mickey and Miney wristbands on for us and we were off.
	The first thing we did was roam around and I wanted to go on a roller coaster called The Tower Of Doom but  Jackson wanted to get some food after that long car ride up here. 
My dad took my brother to get some food while my and my mom were walking to find my favorite roller coaster. While we were roaming the wind picked up and it was crazy. When I was walking, I saw things flying in the air even someone&#39;s pair of underwear. Me and my mom start laughing awkwardly. 
“Do you see your roller coaster yet”? My mom said in a cold attitude. 
I knew for a fact that she was nervous to go on this roller coaster with me.
When we finally arrived we quickly walked in the line stepping over melting popsicles  and goose poop. My mom was shivering in line with a light jacket on that had brown stripes with white polka dots. I thought in my mind  that her jacket looked like garbage can. Get a new one man. 
When  we were getting close to our turn the person guiding us had  nose and lip piercing and all black clothes with dark goth eyes staring right in my soul. He lead us to a rickety roller coaster. We stepped into the seat,  rocking back and forth. 
“Buckle your seat belt” he said with a fraction of a grin.
Me and my mom took one flimsy leather belt and gently buckled it in making a clicking sound. After that we put the bar down that secured us from dying. Me and my mom looked at each other terrified.
	When the roller coaster started I gripped the handle bar so thighly, that it almost came right off. The wheels were very rusty making a high pitched squeaking noise every time it made one lap. We started making our way up the gigantic hill when we got to the top it started racing down like a field of houses. I screamed the whole way until it stopped automatically leading the rusty wheels screeching so loud I thought I lost my hearing .
	We were freaking out and my nerves were kicking in. Thankfully there was a ledge with a lattered that goes all the way down to safety.
“Mom, we can climb down that latter to the ground” I say terrified.
“Great idea” she said proud of me
We carefully unbulke our flimsy seat belt and lift the bar up. We hop right out. First I noticed that it was very slippery. I tried to help my mom on to the platform but I was not strong enough and she slipped but caught herself on a handlebar pulling herself up to safety. 
“Mom are you ok” I say in a panic
“Im good” she said out of breath
“Let’s gently climb down the latter” I say
“ let&#39;s get down quickly too,” she says.
	I step on the rickety latter and start climb down with my mom in front of me. When I am really close to the end the latter starts leaning my way.
“Jump” my mom screams
I take her advice and jump down. It felt like 10 seconds in the air but thankfully I land on my feet squatting and rolling into a summer salt. My mom made it down safely too but jumping higher than me.
“ let&#39;s find Jackson and dad” I say.
“yes” she said.
Sprinting fast and trying to keep up with my mom we were almost there. 
Finally we spotted Jackson and daddy eating cookies and cream ice cream. 
“Let&#39;s go home” mom says.
“Why” dad says.
“Here we go again” I say looking up at my mom.
“ Will tell you in the car” mom says grinning, at least we&#39;re safe.
While we were walking to the car we were telling my dad a long story that happened to us. 
“Another long trip back” I say smiling.
“Yep” Jackson said.
	Holding hands me and Jackson walked to the car and went on our long journey.

&lt;/div&gt; 

I hop out of bed, and go comb my poofy, partially shaved,  blond -to- light blue hair, and Matthew follows. Matthew is a short boy with the same hair but extra poofy and his hair goes from blonde to pink. I change into my black and white, polka dotted button up blouse, round orange tinted glasses, and light yellow jeans. Matthew wears a pink sweater, and white shorts. Stitches knocked on the door. She had short, red hair, and she couldn’t talk. She was wearing awhite hoodie and jeans. Ester walked past. She has emerald green eyes, short black hair, and wore a black mask. She is wearing a black hoodie with a symbol in the corner and black jeans. None of us are related, but we do share a house.
“C’mon, Matt, let get brekky.” I said. 
“I want pink cereal!” matthew yelled as he ran downstairs.
 	“Matthew!” I yelled. I walked down the stairs, and made breakfast. Stitches made eggs, and Ester had cold spaghetti. I made toast for myself. We all finished eating, and got into the van to go camping. Matthew immediately laid down, and took a nap. Ester was driving, Stitches was doing embroidery, and I was drawing. Once we got there, I shook Matt awake, we got out of the car, and got the tents that were in the trunk for about a month now. We took the tents to a clearing and set them up. Matthew and I decided to take an on an off-trail hike. We wanted to go because the regular trail we’d hike on is boring, and this hike lead to a creek. 
		“Hey Matthew, should we walk right or left?” I asked, heaving the bag of supplies.
		“I dunno, what do you think?” Asked Matthew.
		“I say.. Hmm.. right.” 
		“Ok” Responded Matthew.
		I picked up the backpack of supplies, and we headed into the forest area on the right side. 
 		“AAAAHH!!!” Matthew squealed.
		“What is it?!” I yelled.
		“A PRETTY PINK MOTH” Matthew screamed in response.
		“That’s called a rosy maple moth, Matt,”  I said as I patted his fluffy hair.
		“Wow.”
		We continued hiking, and I turned around to see Matthew’s hair coated in a layer of flowers. 
		“Uh, Matt” I asked
		“Yeah, Jay?”
		“Did you rip those flowers out of the ground?”
		“What flowers?”
 		I turned around, and kept walking.
		About an hour later, Matthew groaned. 
		“Are we there yet?”
		“No, Matthew, no we are not.” I heard a thump behind me. I looked over my shoulder to see Matthew laying on the forest floor. I pulled a piece of taffy out of my backpack, and he hopped up. 
			“Oooh! Gimme!” He reached for the piece taffy, and I unwrapped it, and shoved it into my mouth. 
			“There, gone” I said, muffled.
			“Aww.” Matthew frowned and we kept walking. 
			I pointed at the sky. Golden hour. 
			“Sunset? Already?” Matthew asked.
			“But… The creek” Said matthew.
			“Ok, we can go there.” I said.
			The sun set completely, and it was certain. We were lost.
			Coyotes loudly howked, and barked about 10 miles away. Matthew latched onto my arm.
			“It’s ok.” I said, trying to reassure Matthew. He let go and we kept walking. I grabbed my flashlight and flicked it on. There was a fairly steep hill that Mattthew almost toppled down the hill. I crouched down and walked as normal. 
“Jay?” Asked Matthew, breaking the silence.
“Yea, Matt?”
“Are we going to get back home?”	
“I hope so..” I said. Frost started forming on the trees.
“I have a blanket in my bag.” I said
“Let’s make a tent!” Matthew exclaimed. We found a big stick and balanced it on the ground. We draped the blanket over the stick, and got under. 
The howls suddenly started up again, but louder, and closer. I stood up, grabbed Matthew by the arm and pulled him up. I yanked the blanket off the stick, kicked the stick over, and pulled the blanket over Matt and I. We heard footsteps. Lots of them. The pack of coyotes were sniffing the blanket. They started to walk away, and we stood up, and saw distant flashlights
“Ja-a-a-ay?!? Ma-a-athe-e-ew?!?” Both Matthew and I heard someone yelling.
“Wait.. Is that?” Matthew started to ask before I yelled.
“It’s Ester and Stitches!” I recognised Ester by her glowing green goggles she usually wore when she would be walking at night. I don’t know why. I started sprinting towards them, with Matthew following, and carrying the blanket. I practically tackled stitches by hugging her. I was so happy to see them.
“How long were we gone?” Asked Matthew.
“4 hours.” Responded Ester.
“Four hours?!” Yelled Matthew
We got back to camp, and slept the rest of the night.
In the morning we packed everything up, got in the van, and drove home. 
When we got home, we all sat on the couch, Matthew grabbed his juice box, and took a sip.  
“And thus, the story ends.”
“Jay, who are you talking to?” asked Ester. 
“I have no idea.” I responded.

It was a dark and cold night as the Myers family sat down to dinner. Max was hungry so he was eating his steak and mashed potatoes quickly but his little brother Leon was busy flinging the mashed potatoes across the room. “That is unacceptable Leon! You need to clean that up before the dog eats it. Then sit down and eat it like a good boy” said their mom. Leon cleaned up his mess and started eating. “Hi Max, how was your day at school?” asked his dad. “It was awesome! I learned about space!” said Max. “I want to go to space when I grow up!” 

**24 years later**

He ran into the door and got up and got  out his key’s  grabs his dog’s food bowl and rushes over and put the food in the bowl.Poor Lucky he thought.

I’m so happy for you.He thinks to himself .Wow I can’t believe that this is happening.He looks at the time ok it is 6:44 time for bed. The next day was the big day and I was a  little scared. The reason why he was scared is that you never know what is going to happen in space .Now  he is going to get ready for this after  he eats  goes in his car and drives to nasa.Bob gres me at the door .
“Hi Max “ 
“Hi”
“Are you ok you sound  nerves “
“Will&#39;&#39; yes I am “
“There is nothing to be nervous about we promise everything will be ok “
“Ok”
We walk into the building and like everyone was looking at me .I think it  was a good thing I’m not sure .
“Ok you are going to be putting this chip on the moon so we can see if we get any movements there ok”
“Ok “
“Here is you sute go get changed and the chip is in the top left pocket 
“Ok and thank you for this opportunity and I won&#39;t let you down “
“I know you won&#39;t let me down”



     As I walk out and head to the rocket I can hear everyone cheering me on .When I see the rocket it is very big and white and it as tent window.Now  I’m boarding  and sitting and look at the
Hole conchos. Than when I look out the window and see the big crowd looking up at me and the rocket  I feel more nervous than I was.  “We are ready are you” 
“I push the button so I can say yes”
“Ok” countdown from 10.”10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1 And blased off into space .He  felt his stomach drop. Before he knew it he was in space looking at the world.He had never thought about how we live a planet and it is just a big ball of life.As he tries to get closer to the moon.He thinks about if he could just float in space He locast the moon and tell the Bob and land on the moon and looks around and. First puts a maltel plat on the moon than so the chip can stick to the moon.

He looks at how much air he his 20% left  his balmes get swete and he starts to shake he panks oh my god this is not happening to me this was so pose to be fun! Than he thinks if he can hold his breath for a long time he can take the air tank and blast himself back to the rocket so he does and he makes it and opens it  and gets in .The first thing he does is contacted Bob and tells what happened and then he  hits the small green button that blast him back to earth.He can feel the warm fire on the outside of the rocket.

&lt;/div&gt; 
Ali is near the front entrance of the school. The bell had just rung, and kids from his middle school would trample into the main hall to grab their stuff, and their hoverboards. Yes, real hoverboards that fly through the air. Ali’s new hoverboard, the hoverboard 0IV, was one of the newest hoverboards. Ali and Mark were twins, meaning they had the same birthday, meaning they both had the new hoverboard. Their hoverboards could hold storage, like a backpack. Ali stepped up to the schools hoverboard storage and spotted his hoverboard. He touched his hand up to the clear screen that blocked his hoverboard from being stolen. 
The screen paused for a second after scanning Ali’s hand, then the screen disappeared into thin air. Ali grabbed his hoverboard. Kids crowded into the main halls, pushing their ways out the doors and yelling to each other to move so they could grab their stuff. Ali shoved his backpack into his hoverboard storage, and hopped onto it. Ali let it carry him up into the air. The roof on the school had been removed since kids started getting hoverboards. Now kids just floated up, and away. Ali flew away from the school and paused, noticing someone was following him. Once his hoverboard was almost on the ground, he turned to see Mark, his twin brother. 
“Wanna race?” Mark said, poking Ali with his shark tooth necklace Mark always had on. 
“No thanks,” Ali said. According to law, you can’t go over 45 miles per hour till you are 16. 
‘Leave me alone!’ Ali thought as Mark shoved him into a nearby bush. 
“Look, I’m already ahead of you! Better catch up!”  Mark bragged. Ali struggled to lift himself out of the bush. His bookbag had fallen out of his hoverboard storage when he was pushed, and Ali hurried to check if anything in the bag was broken. Nothing. Good. As Ali closed his bag, a paper fell from inside that read:
“ALI WILSON TEST INCOMING. 
 Pick up date: MARCH 14th 2060
Drop off date: ???”

	Ali felt a pit in his stomach. His hand shook as he reached for his pocket where his new IPhone 45 S 6 lay. 
“4:45, Tuesday, March 14. 2060.” His phone read. Today. The men with the white suits were coming to take him against his will. The white suited men are the ones who take the children to the slaughter mill, and they are known for their white coats. No one knows why they wear white coats, they just do.  Ali thought of how Mark was feeling right now. He ought to be at the mini mansion, where Ali and the rest of his family lived. The men would be waiting to take Ali to the slaughter, where Ali would take the test to figure out if he was worthy to live on earth, where overpopulation isn&#39;t much of a problem anymore. The slaughter mill was meant to solve overpopulation without having the Purge, literally. Though Ali enjoyed not having the purge, he still disagreed with having the slaughter mill, half because it wasn&#39;t fair, and half that the test was impossibly hard.  Ali thought of his chance to pass. Very little. He hopped onto his hoverboard and quickly headed home. 
My parents will punish me if I’m even one second late.. Ali thought in despair.
 Ali arrived home, noticing a bus parked beside the house. This bus was not yellow and black, but it wasn’t a school bus. This one said:
 “SM bus, DO NOT TOUCH!” written on it. Slaughter Mill bus. Ali hurried inside. He rushed to pack his flashlight, some extra clothing, some of his favorite candy (Galicmars white chocolate bars), his toothbrush, his phone, his lucky stuffed animal ferret named Salsa and his robot dog named Trest. Trest looked like a normal dog, and was just like one, personality and all. He even got his energy from water and food, and he used to have a charger, but Ali lost it. Ali burst into his large room.
 “Trest!” Ali called, stressed. Trest sprinted over to him, his tail wagging so hard, he knocked Ali’s lamp off its stand. Trest jumped back, spooked from the noise. 
“Poor Trest,” Ali muttered with a snort. Hei quickly grabbed his second bag, put his portable dog food and water bowls into it, and placed Trest in. 
“Sorry boy! I&#39;m going to have to mute you for awhile, but don&#39;t take it personally. I think we’re in danger.” Ali apologized as he closed the bag, with Trest in it. 
The last thing Ali saw as he closed the bag was Trest sitting, tail tucked. 
“Poor boy,” Ali whispered. Ali shoved the rest of his stuff into his bigger bag, including Salsa the ferret and walked outside his room.
“Ali and Mark, time to leave!” Alis mother called from two floors down.
 “Coming!” Ali and Mark replied in unison, racing downstairs. 

	
&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\ 
Chapter 2 \
&lt;/div&gt; 

“Bye Ali!  Bye Mark!” Their mother called as they walked towards the bus. Men wearing white suits hopped out of the bus and forcefully took their bags, throwing them into the bus storage. These men would watch the bus the whole ride, considering almost all cars were automatic because it&#39;s the future. The men would make sure nobody on the bus escaped, no matter what. 
Ali made sure not to sit by Mark, who would tease him the whole ride. He was planning to study most of the ride anyway. Ali remembered the look on his mom’s face when Ali brought home his 2nd grade pretest that Ali failed. The pretest is a test for younger kids that they take to start to get ready for the Slaughter Mill. Ali remembered his mom’s face, full of disappointment and even fear. Fear of what would happen to Ali when he takes the real test. Ali shook his head to clear his thoughts. 
I have to study. He thought desperately as he pulled his small backpack closer to him, opening it. Normally people had fancy ones that open themselves, but Ali had not gotten one, and was fine with his own bag. 
No reason to be lazy I guess. He thought and pulled out a sheet of paper. It was his newest math worksheet.
	A few hours later, Ali sighed as he finished up his studying. The bus was stopping.
 	We’re here. There’s no getting out of this now. He thought with a pit in his stomach.
“Get off the bus!” The men in white suits called, pushing another kid in front of them so they could walk by. A bus full of more kids behind us honked for us to drop off faster, so they could drop of their own kids. Ali hurried out of the bus and grabbed his backpack. He hopped out and looked around. 
Its huge! Ali thought wondrously. The front of the mill had brick walls and railings, and the doors at the front were big and metal. He also saw that near the door there was a fingerprint scanner. The finger scanner would probably only accept staff prints, so students couldn’t get in or out without permission. He spotted some kids running on a nearby field. 
Physical Ability tests. There&#39;s all sorts of tests in the slaughter mill. The math test, reading test, physical ability test, a writing test, and the science test. 
“Ali and Martha are in the same room,” A woman called from the railings in front of the mill. 
“Come forward!” She called to Ali and whoever Martha was. He rushed forward along with the girl, Martha. The woman scanned her fingerprint, and with a loud clunk the door opened for her. 
“Room 45911.” She growled at Martha and Ali. 
“Thank you,” Martha muttered, heading towards the hallways. 
“What are you waiting for? Come on!” She called. Ali hurried to catch up with Martha. The hallways were painted white, and looked like Ali’s middle school. On the walls, there were pictures of people. Famous people. 
People who probably passed the tests. Ali thought miserably. 
 Their room was so high up that it was a wonder it didn&#39;t collapse. Every step they took was loud, and echoed through the seemingly endless hallways. Grey light from the setting sun lit up the mill. 
The slaughter mill looks kind of.. Nice? Ali thought wondrously.
“Hi! Im Martha, as you probably guessed,” Martha said suddenly, spooking Al out of his daydreams of being anywhere else. He nodded quietly. 
“Your Ali?” Martha asked when Ali didn’t reply.  
“Yup.” He answered quietly. They walked in awkward silence for a while. 
“Here we are!” Martha exclaimed, stopping in front of room 4591. 
“Look! We can scan our fingers here!” She said, excited. She put her finger to the scanner. The door opened automatically with a loud creak. 
“Come on!”  Ali called in his excitement, rushing into the room. The room was nice, and the middle had a red and yellow rug made of thick yarn. On the sides had two small cheap couches with two desks in front of them with a amp on each. On the sides of the middle room were doorways into three smaller rooms. Ali peared in to see One small twin sized bed in each room. The windows, one in both rooms, including the middle one were barred over sighty. No escape I guess. Ali looked into a third room. Its was a bathroom. It was dirty but still had a toilet, shower and sink. 
“Your stuff is here!” A voice called into the room, and with a thump, the stuff got thrown onto the ground. 
“Uh thanks?” Ali tried to call, but the person was gone.  Ali thought about Trest. “Hey.. do you like dogs? Or robot dogs?” Ali asked.
 “Yes!” Martha said, still looking around to rooms. He reached for the bag he put Trest in and opened it. Trest came bursting out. Trest barked wildly, but no sound came from his mouth, because he was on mute. Ali turned the sound low, but not off and unmuted Trest. Small faint barks erupted around him. Ali hugged Trest happily.
 “Aww! He&#39;s so cute! What&#39;s his name?” Martha asked.
 “Trest” Ali replied happily.
 “Trest is a cute name!” Martha said, rubbing Trests head. Treat looked so happy at that moment, Ali was afraid he might explode. No one has ever loved him but me. Jealousy crawled over Ali but he ignored it, it wouldn&#39;t be fair to hog Treat from Martha. Ali peered outside to find the stars appearing in the sun&#39;s disappearing trial. 
“We should get ready for bed. There&#39;s testing tomorrow” Ali said, digging through his bag. “I&#39;ll sleep in this room,” Ali said, pointing to the room closest to him. He finally found what his was digging in his bag, a pouch in his bag with an electric toothbrush, metallic tooth strengthening toothpaste, and his electric flossers. Ali hurried into the bathroom. He started to brush his teeth when Martha and Trest walk into the bathroom. 
“Hello!” Martha said, her mouth muffed by her toothbrush that was now buzzing in her mouth. He heard the clicking of Trest’s claws as he played down between them.
Ali grabbed his blanket and pulled it over his body. Both him and Martha had gone to bed. After brushing his teeth, Ali had pulled out his portable cage and let t Test crawl into it. Trest could not make a noise. The mills states “No pets of any sort are permitted in the rooms”. 
	
&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\ 
Chapter 3 \
&lt;/div&gt; 


“Wake up Ali! You need to get up!” Martha called, knocking on the door. 
“Coming..” Ali murdered. The tests! Ali hopped out of bed and ripped into his bag. He grabbed his clothes for the day and with a small regret he ignored Trest. My teeth can wait for later. He hurried out the door. Martha was waiting near the door to the hallways. 
“Hurry!” Martha hissed. 
“Come on, let&#39;s go! It&#39;s breakfast!” Ali said following Martha down the hallways. She knew the way down the hallway, her brother gave her a small map. 
“This way..” Martha sometimes Whispered as they took a turn. There&#39;s no one in the hallways. “We are here!” Martha exclaimed happily. The lunchroom was full of chattering kids. At the back there was a line to get food. The tables were long and had to sides. Five tables in total. No natural light, only artificial. Ali hurried to get in line with Martha.
	After Ali had finished lunch, he pulled out his schedule. With a sigh, he walked into the hallways where big signs showed all the rooms. 
Ali walked back to the room. He had finished all the tests and felt terrible. During the tests the staff pressured  the kids so much that Ali had sweat through the test even when it was not the speed of one. These tests were his life. And maybe death. Ali entered the room with a gasp. His stuff was all over the floors, some of his clothes were torn, and his stuffed ferret, lucky was laying on the floor, not torn but wet. 
“TREST!” Ali cried out. The robot dog came bursting across the room to meet him. 
“Bad boy! Trest into the crate!” Ali said pointing to the crate. Trest  stumbled into his cage, tail between his legs. Ali felt bad, but this was not ok. Martha came bursting through the door. 
“I feel great!” Martha called. Test gave a small wag in his cage, but settled down. “I just know I passed my tests!” Martha said, more calmed down. If that&#39;s how you feel if you pass, then time for an escape plan. He thought of the HOGS or Hidden Organization for Getaway Students. Rumors are they hide in the mountains right nearby this slaughter mill. They save any runaway students they find. Ali dug into his backpack to find his knife. The corners of the rooms were big thick logs, but would be the only way out. Better start now. Ali grabbed his knife and started cutting a dent into the wall. 
“What are you doing?” Martha asked, surprised at his sudden action. 
“Getting my way out. Duh.” Ali said, continuing his slicing. 
“Why? You don&#39;t even know if you failed!” Martha exclaimed. 
“I failed and I know it!” Ali replied. “Trest unlock cage and help dig!” Ali commanded. With a yip, Trest got out and started biting chunks off the wood. 
“Ali!” Martha hissed. Ali stopped at her commanding tone. “Look up” Martha snapped. Ali slowly looked up. A camera. Oh no! How did I not notice? Intense knocking rocked the room. “Treat invisible and mute” Ali whispered as he got up to open the door. 
“Open up Ali!” A male voice said as he banged on the door. Ali opens up the door. “Pack up you and your friend are moving rooms. I will not have a failing kid escape!” He said, shoving Ali backwards towards the bedrooms. Ali rushed into his room shoving his ripped clothes into his bag. 
“Trest into bag” Ali whispered. He felt weight in the pack and closed it with a sigh. When he had packed everything, he grabbed the dog carrier and rushed to the door. Martha was already there, glaring at him. 
“Follow me, and don&#39;t try to escape.” The man said. When they arrived to the new room, it was a level higher from their other one. It looked just like it, but no windows. “And here your grades got in” He said, handing them letters. Ali opened it. 


		“Caution! Ali Wilson failed tests, execution date: two days.” 

	I failed my test. I failed my life. Martha screeched happily behind him. 
“I passed!” She yelped. She looked at him with sympathy. You didn&#39;t pass did you?” Martha asked. 
“No..” Ali sighed. Ali yelped when Martha rushed towards him and gave him a hug. “I&#39;m so sorry Ali” She whispered. 
“Take trest” Ali whispered. 
“What?” Martha cried. 
“If I die, take Test for me. His favorite food is beef jerky. His favorite flavor water is lemon.” Ali replied. 
“You&#39;re not dying. I&#39;m going to get you out. You will see!” Martha said turning to grab her map and examining it. 
“Goodnight Martha i&#39;d better head to bed.” Ali said, now tired after a long day. His head hurt a lot but his eyes dropped at once.

	“Ali you will be gone by lunch!” Ali heard Martha say from the other room. Ali was changing into his clothes excitedly. Marthas going to let me escape! 
“I&#39;ll see you later!” Martha said, rushing out of their room.
 “Cya?” Ali asked. He packed his stuff again. He would leave Treats bag here. It was too heavy to take with him. Ali sat down at a desk and took out his iphone, going to the minecraft app.

Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt; 



Thirty minutes later an alarm shook the mill. It sounded like Trest when Ali came home. It was so loud. He heard just barley, kids crowding outside rooms. 
“Stay in your rooms, someone opened the front doors!” A staff shouted. My escape! Martha! Ali grabbed his pack and Trest and zipped out the room. He sprinted down the stairs with the other crowds of kids. Staff were blocking every few routes, Ali made sure to avoid them. Light flowed into the halls as he neared the front doors. My escape. 
“Go Ali! Run! Run as fast as you can!” Someone called. Martha! Ali rushed outside. What about Mark? I can&#39;t leave him! 
“Ali is that you?” Someone called. Is that..? The person knocked into him, trapping him in a hug. “Mark!” Ali said happily. He changed! “We have to leave!” Mark said, dragging Ali by his wrists towards the forest. Many kids were rushing down roads. 
“We should follow-” Ali started. 
“No they are going home. Little do they know, that&#39;s not so safe either!” Mark exclaimed. They had made it into the forest and stopped to rest. Ali noticed Mark didn&#39;t have his pack. 
“Where&#39;s your stuff?” Ali asked.
 “Didn&#39;t have time to get it. I was on the third floor. It takes forever to get down. Hope you have extra” Mark said with a sigh. 
“Not much, Trest ate most” Ali said with a snort. Mark snorted. Ali stared at him with surprise. 
“You have really changed.” Ali said. 	
“Yeah I know. I met someone named East. he was really nice. I realized what a person I was” Mark said.
“We have to keep going. We have to make it to the mountains by night time so we can look for the hogs with the morning. 
“Oh I brought a survival book!” Ali exclaimed happily. 
“Good!” Mark said, walking towards the mountains. 
	They successfully arrived at the mountains before nightfall and were able to find a small shelter in a hollowed tree. Ali pulled out Trest. 
“Warmer on” Ali said. The night was cold and frosty but on the inside of the tree it was toasty due to the warmth Trest generated. 
“Good boy” Ali whispered before falling asleep. 
	“Hurry! Get up Ali!” MArk whispered into his ear. 
“What the heck?” Ali asked. 
“The population police are here! We have to run!” Marm said, packing up Ali’s stuff into a bag. 
“Ok make sure Trest gets into the bag.” Ali said, getting up. 
“Follow me, and be silent!” Mark whispered, picking up the bag. Ali followed Mark into the cold forest with a shiver. Its was starting to be fall and soon winter. What a terrible thing. 
“Come out, come out wherever you are!” an angry voice called out into the forest. Escape hunters!  
“Your going to scare them off dirt face!” Another voice snapped. 
“Run!” Mark whispered as the two escape hunters had gotten close their hiding spot. Mark and Ali spinted through the forest together while the hunters fell behind. After perhaps  an hour of running, the boys collapsed onto the ground in exhaustion. They had lost the hunters for now. The boys sat in silence, their heavy breath was the only sound. Mark finally got up.
 “We show shelter here till we find the HOGS, it won&#39;t be long now!” Mark sighed. 
“Ok” Ali agreed. Ali took a sip from the little amount of old water he had left in his water bottle. It was warm and tasted like metal and dirt. Even now, 2060 inventors can&#39;t keep water clean and cold.
 “Gather sticks i&#39;ll put them into a tp.” Mark said, leaning large sticks against a big tree. Ali started to gather the slicks around them into a pile until it the tower of sticks was leaning, threatening to fall down. 
“That should be good Ali, thanks” Mark said, dragging the sticks towards the start of the tp. “Go find something to eat, will you?” Mark asked. 
“Sure!” Ali said, pulling Trest out his backpack. He flipped the on button and commanded him to find something edible. The happy robot dog leaped into the forest in search. As Ali started to pick wild berries from a bush, Trest hopped out of the forest with a dead bird in his jaws. 
“What is that?” Ali asked. “I&#39;m not eating roadkill! Birds probably aren&#39;t edible anyway! Drop it!” Ali exclaimed. But Trest wouldn&#39;t budge “Fine go bring it to Mark, even he will tell you to put it back.” Ali said, filling his now empty water bottle with berries. When it was full, he picked his way back to camp. The sun was setting behind him as he arrived. I smell smoke. Mark sat under a few trees, with a fire going in front of him. 


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\ 
Chapter 5\
&lt;/div&gt; 


Over the fire was the dead bird that Trest brought back. 
“Your cooking that?” Ali cried, disgusted. 
“Your not getting some kind of fancy roasted beef with a side of chicken salad. Eat or don&#39;t eat. More for me!” Mark exclaimed.
 “I eat my berries thank you very much!” Ali said, pulling out his water bottle full of berries. Trest got up from where he sat at the fire and sprinted at an alarming rate towards Ali. Ali yelped as Trest leaped up at him, knocking the water bottle out of his hands. The berrys spilled out of the water bottle and only the dirt. “Trest! Bad boy!” Ali screamed. Trest continued to pounce onto the berries, crushing them and rubbing dirt into them. “Stop it Trest!” Ali cried, dragging the dog away from the destroyed berries. 
“He’s trying to protect you Ali” Mark said, walking towards the berries. “Those could have killed you.” Mark said after studying the berries. “Come eat the bird with me. We can give the feathers and bones to Trest for energy.” Mark said, cutting the bird into small pieces. 
	After the bird was eaten, they worked together to gather to soft pines for bedding in the tp. Ali flipped the off button on Trest to save battery and headed to bed. 
	Ali woke to days later from when he ate the bird. Yesterday was boring, they had roasted insects and leaves for dinner and lunch and all they could do was walk around and look. 
“Be careful today, there&#39;s a storm coming” Mark said from outside. “I&#39;m gonna start looking, i&#39;ll be back by dinner!” Mark called, leaving the camp. Ali got up with a  stretch. 
“Trest, power on.” Ali said, walking out the tp. Trest barked loudly behind him. “Come on boy! Time for searching!” Ali said. At the fireplace, there was a small pile of healthy wild blueberries. Ali gobbled them up, and left the camp. 
	With Treat on his heels, he trudged around the woods. The HOGS have to be here somewhere. Right? His shoes were scraped and destroyed for walking in thorns and tripping over roots and bushes. Large claw marks scratched onto the side of a tree came into view. Maybe the HOGS did it? 
“Trest, is it them?” Ali asked, pointing to the tree. Trest padded over to it and sniffed. Trest walked away with a shake of his fluffy head. “Ok then.” Ai said running to catch up. With a weird noise, Trest collapsed onto the ground in front of Ali. He lost battery! Ali picked up Trest’s body. It was surprisingly light for a robot. Ali grunted as rain started pouring from the dark storm clouds crowding the sky. Good thingTrest is waterproof. Ali turned around with a huff. It was time to go home or back to the shelter. Ali peered down at Trests energyless body “Don&#39;t worry bud, ill get you charged soon” Ali had to yell to even hear himself. 
	It felt like hours before he heard voices. 
“Mark? Is that you! I&#39;m coming!” Ali yelled. The rain was coming down harder. He trudged closer. 
“Hurry, this way to our shelter! We will keep you dry!” A voice yelled. 
“Our? We?” Ali questioned. 
“This way!” The voice said again. This isn&#39;t Mark. He followed the voice anyway. Ahead of him, a group of people, mainly children were following a yelling man. Ali joined the crowd. 
After a while of walking, the group arrived at a large cave. The kids hurried in. 
“Settle down! Get in groups of two, and we will check on everyone in a second.” The commanding voice called. In front of him sat a familiar looking boy. The boy turned around  and hugged him. Mark! And the bag! Ali sat with Mark. 
“How did you get here?” they asked at the same time. 
“Well-” The said the same time again. Ali let him speak. 
“Well, I found the group as they were passing nearby camp, grabbed the stuff and followed.” Mark said slowly. 
“Yeah me to, I got lost and found the group, I think we found the HOGS!” Ali exclaimed. 
“Hello there! Uhh you were looking for us?” one of the staff traveling from the group said as they came up to Mark and Ali.
 “Yeah, we escaped a mill with each other looking for-. Are you the HOGS?” Mark asked. 
“Ehem yes but your not welcome without being saved.” The man said. 
“But we have nowhere else to go!” Mark exclaimed. “I&#39;ll see what I can do,&#39;&#39; the man said turning towards the leader of the group. 
After what seemed like forever, the leader walked up to them. 
“You can stay, but the other staff will be skeptical for a bit.” He sighed. 
“Oh thank you!” Ali said. He couldn&#39;t help but get up and hug the man. He smiled but walked away towards the other groups of kids. 
Later all the kids got beds to sleep in. Ali and mark got beds near each other. Ali had a hard time sleeping, but after a while, he finally closed his eyes and fell into a dreamless peaceful sleep. 
Over the next few days, Ali and Mark helped out as much as they could around the cave, with food, water or whatever. This morning, Ali and a group of other kids were out looking for berries with newly charged Trest. Trest barked happily as he found a nice bush. 
“Good boy!” Ali said, filling the basket the HOGS had given him to collect food with berries. After Ali had collected the while bush,he headed farther the direction he was going before. As he spotted another bush, Trest started barking hysterical. 
“Trest shush!” Ali said, alarmed. Trest was staring into the shadows on the right side of the bush. “Bear!” Ali screamed to the rest of the kids. They started panicking, screaming and running around in panic. Ali’s instinct was to run with them, run as fast as possible, but he remembered what his survival book said about bears- don&#39;t run, back away slowly. And if it attacks? I can&#39;t remember! Ali backed away, grabbing a sharp stick he passed when backing off.

Chapter 6\
&lt;/div&gt; 

“Stay away!” Ali said, flinging his arms about, half to look bigger, half to keep the other kids behind him. The bear rose to two feet, and with a roar, charged at him. Ali flung his stick at the bears face. The bear shrieked in pain, backing off with one paw pawing at its face. The bear fled into the woods, still roaring. 
“Please clap for Ali Wilson, who protected the food finding group from a bear!” The group leader cried out. Clapping exploded around the cave, slowly fading off. Ali had made it home with the others. Ali felt like he could almost burst with pride. “Please head to your beds and have a good night” The leader said, walking towards Ali as everyone gathers cleared off. 
“Hey Ali we are doing a breakout tomorrow, would you like to attend the breakout, and help the failing kids escape and come home? May I warn you, you could die” The leader warned. 
“Yes I want to come!” Ali exclaimed. 
“And bring your stuff with you. You might get  lost. Oh and your brother, what’s his name? Oh Mark can come” He said, walking away. Ali hurried to Mark to explain what was going to happen. 
When Ali woke up in the morning, his stuff already packed he hopped up and woke Mark. 
“It&#39;s time to go! Get up fast!” Ali whispered. Mark got up with a yawn and together they went into the meeting cave, the first and biggest part of the cave. When they got there, they were the last ones to the whole group started walking right away.
 “It&#39;s the next closest mill” Said a lady as they joined the group. 
“It should only take three hours to walk there” Said a man. The group traveled fast and swift. And after what seemed and felt like years, they arrived at a mill that looked kind of like the one Ali went too, but smaller. The walls were more protected. They had bits of metal between the bricks used to make it. 
“Ok plan A, bombs. Breaking into the hallways. Plan B, uhh” Said a man near the front of the group. Three of the adults in the group sprinted towards the nearest part of the building, holding a total of three bombs in each hand. After a few minutes the bombs blew the side of the walls. Ali watched as one of the adults that handled the bombs was to slow and got tossed into the air as the bomb exploded the wall. The other two made it back to the forest, they had complete their jobs. 
“Run run run! Get as many people out as possible!” A woman cried. The large group sprinted to collect the kids gathering outside. 
“Population police!” Someone cried. The police streamed out of the building. The HOGS members cried out in panic, sprinting back to the cover of the forest in large groups. The HOGS leader had said if they run into trouble, like the escape hunters or population pilice for example, we run as fast as we can. Ali and Mark sprinted around the exploded walls, not knowing where to flee to. The police approached them, cornering them. To a not so damaged wall.
“Hey kids! Come here! Hurry!” Said a man, tackling a policeman to the ground. The man who tackled the police got up quickly, and grabbed Ali and Mark’s wrists, dragging them towards the forest with him and another woman. When they arrived, deeper into the forest, they stopped to rest for a minute. 
“Sorry I had to rush you out so fast, my name is Mathew, but you can call me Matt, this is my wife, Rose” Matt said, still panting from the running. Rose smiled from where she was crouching over a patch of grass. 
“Im Mark, and this is my brother, Ali” Mark introduced. 
“Oh, this is Trest” Ali said, pulling Trest out his pack, and flipping the on switch. Trest barked happily, sniffing Rose and Matt. 
“Cute boy isn&#39;t he?” Rose laughed. 
“We should keep going.There&#39;s no way back to the HOGS, we will have to find somewhere else,” Matt said. 
The group started at a jog slowly progressing. The group ran all day including Trest, and the next and the next. Three days of running, walking and traveling.
“Here!” Matt exclaimed happily. They had been searching for a place to settle for a day now, but not alot of places had enough food, water, or cover for a house. “This is the perfect space for a cabin! See look, it has bushes and trees for camoflodge. And look a small pond!” He said, pointing towards a small cliff with an intent. He looked at Mark and Ali. “Are you willing to help us build it?” Matt asked hopfully. 
“Of course!” Ali and Mark said at the same time. 
“Ok lets start now. Me and Rose are on log duty. Mark and Ali can you dig a large hole from the indent? We need it big enough for a room, and logs to cover the dirt.” Matt ordered. Ali nodded grabbing a sturdy stick, testing it on the soft cliff dirt. It worked fine. Ali and Mark got to work on the cliff.They scraped together at the side of the indents while Rose and Matt colected and chopped logs.  They talked about Mark&#39;s friend, East, and Ali’s friend, Martha and other people Mark and Ali met. Mostly Mark. By sunset, the indent was almost large enough. While Mark and Ali were finishing the day’s work, Matt and Rose were cooking up a trout they caught earlier that day. The fish was inside a log Matt was pulling out of the river. He pulled it out so fast it didnt have time to escape. ‘I can&#39;t wait to eat fish! Cooked and all!’ Ali thought.
“Dinner’s ready!” Ali had a small flashback to when his mother called out that dinner was ready every day at his mantion. Ali’s heart hurt for a second at the thought of it He raised from his spot and ate his share of the fish. 
“Good work today! We start on the logs tomorrow. We need mud for insolation. “Can you gather that Ali?” Rose asked. 
“Oh sure!” Ali said. I get the easiest jobs. Probably cause im so thin. That night was cold and Trest had lost his battery again. They all slept on the dirt floor inside the indent Mark and Ali had made but Ali felt warm and happy. A fuzzy feeling.

Chapter 7\
&lt;/div&gt;

	It’s been a whole year! A whole year since Ali had met Martha. A whole year since the slaughter mill. A whole year since Mark had gotten nice. A whole year since they got into the HOGS. A year since they had met their new adopted parents, Matt and Rose. After they had finished the cabin Rose and Matt asked to adopt Ali and Mark. Ali felt like he could burst from happiness even thinking about it. The cabin turned out to be two floors after they finished the first, Ali and Mark made their own room, one level higher. Ali had even made Trest a wooden cage. There&#39;s a grocery store  two miles from their cabin they went for supplies. They used the money Matt and Rose had brought. 
	“Hey Ali, you know where the best blueberry bushes are, can you take me to get some?” Matt asked from the other room.
	“Sorry im helping Rose knit clothes but you can take Trest, he know better spots!” Ali called. 
	“Ok thanks Ali!” Matt called. 
“Hey rose, what do you think you will name your children?” Mark asked, next to Ali. The cabin had three rooms, not including the bathroom. It had a living room with a fireplace, and a few couches they made out of old couches people illegally leave on the sides of the roads. They had knit a carpet out of thick wool and a baby bed for Rose’s child. She was giving birth soon. She insists there&#39;s twins. 
“I want to name them Breeze and North” Rose said happily. Mark, Ali and Rose were in the living room, knitting baby clothing. The second room was Matt’s and Rose’s room. They had a big bed and a closet in the corner. That&#39;s almost it. In the twins room, Mark and Ali’s room had two twin sized beds and a rug and Trests cage. All the rooms had a window. The cabin was very old fashioned, but it felt nice to to be flying on a hoverboard or staring at a phone. The door opened again. 
“I&#39;m back already!” Matt called.Trest skeeted into the room happily.  “I&#39;ll start on dinner!” Matt called
“Alright dad!” Ali called. Yes. Dad sounds nice. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="42" name="Nate D." tags="" position="372,1213" size="100,100">&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\

RING! The bell rung, finally first period’s done, I think to myself. I walk out of the classroom and see Barry my best friend but I don’t see Chandler my other best friend. “Hey, what’s up Barry?”  I said. 
“Hey Adam, have you seen Chandler yet today?”  Barry asked. 
“No, I haven’t. Have you?” I said back.
 “No, I wonder where he is?” Barry said. “Maybe he’s at Student Council, that’s usually today.”
” We’ll see him later probably,” I say.  “Well, see ya at lunch!” 
“Alright, bye!” Barry says. 

As I walk to second period I see Chandler walk into a different room than second period and he’s in my second period so I follow him. The room he went into is the teachers lounge so I go in and find Chandler looking at a TV with the news on so I look at the TV and the news says that Mt. Nam is showing signs of volcanic activity and it will erupt in a couple of hours so evacuate the city while you can.

 “Chandler we need to warn everyone in the school but how?” I ask.
“ The principal&#39;s office has the one speaker that goes through the whole school.”Chandler said.

We head to the principal’s office running as fast as we possibly can! We finally make it to the principal’s office. We explain to Mrs. Ridge what we saw on the news and tell her that she has to announce on the speaker that everyone must evacuate the building in an orderly fashion and head east so we will be out of range from the lava. She sends us back to our class and says she will make the announcement. But we don’t go to our class, we go straight to Barry’s second period, to get him out of his class.

We get to Barry’s class and knock on the door. Mrs. Kinson opens the door and we ask her if we could take Barry to his homeroom because he forgot something there so he could go get it. I lie. And she lets him. But really, we wanted to get him out of class so he could come with us.
“ Ok, so Barry, here’s what&#39;s going on.  Mt. Nam is a volcano and it will erupt in an hour or two and Mrs. Ridge is going to make an evacuation announcement soon and all of us are going to head east to get away from the lava when Mt. Nam erupts,” I explained. 
“Ok but how do you guys know all this?” Barry asked
“I saw Chandler walk into the teacher’s lounge and I followed him in. The TV in there had the news on and the heading said Mt. Nam is an active volcano and the scientist dude they were interviewing said that the eruption would happen in two to three hours or so and that was a half hour ago,” I said.  
Barry looked out the window and saw Mt. Nam with fire on the top of it.
	“ Uh guys look out the window,’’ Barry said. Chandler and I look out the window and we are horrified at the scene.  “It looks like it’s going to be here sooner than they predicted!”

The speaker at Vail Creek Middle School turns on.
” Everyone evacuate the building immediately. Repeat everyone evacuate the building immediately,” Mrs. Ridge announced on the speaker. Everyone starts bursting out of every classroom and we all start to run outside then the ground starts to shake. And then I see it the lava coming down Mt. Nam and then two buildings collide and a piece of glass hits me in the leg and makes a huge gash and I start to bleed Barry and Chandler help me up and I put my arms around each of their shoulders and I limp as fast as possible and they never leave my side even though they know lava is coming down from Mt. Nam right towards the city then another piece of glass comes down from a different building and hits Chandler straight in the face but it’s only a cut in the forehead. The lava is already here and it’s coming fast. 
“We gotta make it to higher ground,’’ I say. 
We start running to where everyone else went and then the lava bubbles and hits Barry in the arm and burns him.
“ Ahhhhhhh,” Barry yells.
As we finally make it to higher ground we see everyone from school and some other people we don’t know and we walked over to them.

There’s a couple other people that are hurt but we got hurt far worse than the other people that are hurt. We ask people if there’s any first aid kit but they say there isn’t any first aid kit. Then we ask if there’s any search and rescue team but they said they don’t know anything right now. I take my shirt off for a bandage for my leg and Barry does the same thing but Barry is hurt far worse than me. Barry screams when he ties his shirt around his arm I feel horrible knowing there’s nothing I can do to help him.  And Chandler just dabs his cut on his head with his shirt. 
“We should go try to find a stream of water to clean our injuries,” I say.
“I agree,” Barry says.
“Ok let’s go find a stream,” Chandler says.
We start walking towards trees hoping we find water. I look back to get a better look of the city and all I see is fire and tilted buildings and I feel angry at myself knowing that people probably died. Then we keep going on our adventure to find water. 


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    One hour later\
&lt;/div&gt;


We finally found water and we’ve been hiking for like an hour. 
“Guys we finally found water. Who’s gonna go in first?” I asked.
“I will,” Barry said.
“Ok, well go in,” I say.
Barry walks into the stream of water and then puts his arm in and it looks so painful.
	“ Ahhhhhhh,” Barry screams.
Barry walks out of the stream.
	“ It looks a lot better ,” I exclaim.
I walk in and the pain shocks my leg and I start screaming and then it doesn’t hurt anymore.  And I walk out and the cut looks fine now but it will for sure be a scar.
Then Chandler puts his hand in the water and splashes it on his face.
	“ Ahh much better,”Chandler says.
	“Good thing I never took my backpack off this morning, we can eat the lunch my mom packed, and refill my water bottle,” I tell my friends.

After we all eat and drink, we save a little food for later, fill the water bottle and rest up.  
	“We should head back to where everyone is,” I say.  Barry and Chandler agree.  
We start walking back towards where we came.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Another hour passes\
&lt;/div&gt;


We finally make it back to where everyone is.  They are all walking south and they aren’t staying here in Dexton.
 	“ Wait where are you guys going?” I yell.
	“ To find safety,” someone yells back.
I can’t believe they are just gonna leave knowing that they probably still have loved ones in the city.
“We are gonna go through the city and find our parents and siblings,” I say.
“ Ok but how?” Chandler asks.
“ We go through the city and go straight towards our neighborhood,” I say.
We start walking towards the ruined city of Dexton.
“ Alright here we go,” I think to myself.
Our first sight of the city streets, the lava isn’t flowing anymore, it’s stopped and the heat doesn’t feel as hot when we are close to it.
	“ How do we get across without going in the lava?” Chandler asks
	“ I don’t know. Look around There has to be something we can use to get across,” I said.  
	“I see something, over there on the right!”  exclaimed Barry.  “I think it’s the top of a bus.”
	“If we are going to do this, I think you’re right.  We will have to make our way from the tops of things stuck in the lava,” I finish his thought.

We continue on together, through the lava filled city.  Most of the buildings are so damaged, it is hard to tell where we are exactly.  We take breaks every so often to sip the water, careful not to drink it all at once. 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    The daylight begins to fade\
&lt;/div&gt;


	We have finally made it through the city!  We keep walking in the direction of our neighborhood, looking for signs of anything that looks familiar. 
	“Hey guys, is that the top of the monkey bars from the park in our neighborhood?” I ask.  
	“ Ya I think it is the same sky blue and yellow bars,” Barry says.
	“ We finally made it to our neighborhood,” I say.
	“ Can we go to my house first?” Chandler asked.
	“ Sure,” I say.
The lava finally stopped flowing, and only ash covers the ground. So we can just peacefully walk to Chandler’s house without risking our lives to cross a street, we just have to walk two more blocks to Chandler’s house.
“ I wonder if my family is at my house. I sure hope they are,” Chandler says.
“ They probably are,” Barry said.
“ Yeah I bet they are,” I say.
We finally made it to Chandler’s house. Knock Knock Knock. We knock on the door.
Bum Bump Bump. 
“Someone’s in there for sure,” I say.
Click. The door opens. And the person is Chandler&#39;s Mom and she starts crying.
	“ Sweet heart you’re alive!!  Come in here, all of you!” exclaims Chandler’s Mom.
We all walk in and follow Chandler’s mom to the living room and everyones there my family Barry’s family and of course Chandler’s family. They are all there, I can’t believe  it. I start to cry.
	“ How’d all of you know to come here?” I ask.
	“ This house was closest to Vail Creek Middle School,” My mom says.
We are all safe and I am so glad that all of our families are safe. I’ll never forget how we stuck together throughout the whole time and we never left each other behind. I’ll never forget how we survived the eruption of Mt. Nam.
The End

 “GET UP AND GET TO THE MESS HALL IN 5 MINUTES!” the Sergeant would always yell to us. Im private first class Brown and I was the tail gunner of our B-17-G. It was always really early in the morning, and we would all jump up when the Sergeant yells at us! 
I’m from Colorado our pilot is captain Anderson also form Colorado. In addition,  there’s co-pilot sergeant Cooke from Michigan, the Ball turret gunner, Private first class Halpape. Waist gunners private second class Boyd from Florida and the other waist gunner corporal Yuan, he’s from New York. 
Our trusted B-17 G bomber plane named, “Weihnachtsmann” which translated means “Father Christmas” is waiting on the runway. The first mission started at around 4:00 AM when we were called in for mission briefing we were told that our squadron part of the 8th Air force would like up with the 5th regiment and bomb the target area dresden. we were told that the casualties would not be very high. We climbed into our plane on the foggy february morning and pilot anderson said on the radio								“ATC are we clear for takeoff?” With the reply of							“You are clear for takeoff, be careful out there.”							“Copy on our way.” The massive four engine heavy bombers propellers started spinning and we lurched forward down the runway and we were off the ground. I tried to get comfortable but the cramped place with ammunition and two massive 50. Cal machine guns made it impossible to get comfortable then the clouds cleared and I saw the faint outline of England from my view and then the most magnificent thing I will probably ever see hundreds of brown,green,and silver bombers all b-17s appear from out of the clouds but the amazement didn&#39;t last long as waist gunner Halpape yelled.											“FLAK INCOMING THE BOMBER IN MY VIEW IS UP IN FLAMES!”				“ I SEE THAT!” I yelled as I looked out the window the brown B-17 that was next to us was nose diving, out of the 10 crew members on that plane I only saw 1 make it out alive.Suddenly the anti aircraft fire “flak” as we called it stopped and the lead bomber in our formation shouted on the intercom											“FIGHTERS RIGHT AHEAD!”									From the shape of their wings I could tell they were Fw 190s but there were a few  planes I didn’t know but they were fast very very fast. When the lead planes (the fast ones) started firing our gunners opened fire right away, but our gun turrets were to slow to catch them. Then one of the fastest planes sped behind our plane and i got a look at it. I was shocked because the plane hand no propellers! What plane could possibly have no propellers and have that speed? But then it turned on us from the tail the top gunner opened fire  and so did i the plane tailing us burst into flames and started stalling 									“GOT HIM!” I yelled through the headset 								“OPEN BOMB BAY DOOR AND GOOD JOB!” yelled co pilot cooke				“OPENING BOMB BAY!” pilot Anderson shouted						“BOMBS AWAY!” yelled co pilot cooke							“FIGHTER RIGHT AHEAD, TURNING ON OUR LEFT GET READY HALPAPE!”		and then it happened very fast  Halpape  opened fire and the fast plane that had a green and black painting colour  turned on us andhalpape got a perfect shot with his single 50. Cal  and blew the engine of it to pieces. Then a squadron of Bf109s, the most produced plane in the luftwaffe ( the German air force) came up but they were merciless taking out a b-17 right through the front and then it turned for us. The aircraft shot right through our engine but that&#39;s when the miracle happened about 20 of our p-51 mustangs came out of the clouds and blew the bf109 tailing us to pieces so the remaining german aircraft  retreated because of of the P-51s firepower. We turned the plane but we did not realize that the  wing behind the engine  was damaged so under te weight of the body the wing broke in half and then the flak opened up.  A shell exploded in the front of the plane and we started to nosedive  our aircraft split in two parts so Yaun and halpae were on my side and the pilots were in the front. I quickly got on the parachute and jumped into the freezing air through the place where the plane was split in two and the last time I saw the plane  was when it smashed into the ground and flames were everywhere. When I landed  there were germans everywhere pointing their “Schmeisser” smgs right at my face they picked me up and one hit me in the back of my head so  I blacked out.			When I woke up I was lying on the floor of a cold wet cell they had given me a german uniform beside my bed so I put it on I. I looked around and found a small window with bars and a bowl of some sort of mush on the entry with a massive steel door. I climbed on the bed and looked out the window there was my crew then a voice came from behind me											“was just du?” I spun around to see a young german soldier with a rifle in his hands. He saw my German uniform and started laughing he must have thought  I was german and got myself locked in I thought he unlocked it and I charged out spilling the mush everywhere he raised his rifle but I knocked him over before he could shoot his head slammed against the wall and he blacked out. I picked up his rifle and headed out the door, the guard turned and must have been terrified when the door flung open and a man in a german uniform aimed at him because he flung up his hands and I pointed him in the direction of the prison and he ran in. The soldier dropped his SMG which was a schmeisser I picked it up and put the rifle on my back when I ran into the courtyard it was filled with germans but I had the element of surprise and opened fire to finish them off quickly. In the courtyard there was a American flag on the wall which I had no idea why now but I picked it up and ran into the next yard and found my crew, but the Germans were ready and a MG42 opened up from the window of a huge brick building and dirt flew up everywhere it was chaos absolute chaos I threw the rifle to cooke and he bolted the bolt and hid behind me I raised the American flag and we charged Anderson,Boyd,Yaun,and Halpape got weapons from the Germans in the previous yards and opened fire a german armoured car smashed right through a wall and opened fire it was a “puma” as we  called it, I clambered on top of it threw open the hatch and fired a whole magazine into the vehicle taking out everyone inside I called for us all to get in so we did and I raised the american flag over it and BOOM whoever was the gunner (i was not in it i was on the back) got a shell through the window that the mg42 was firing through . We sped forward and i was firing my gun at the germans  we hit a bump and got some air then the firing stopped i saw fellow American soldiers cheering and they all started firing at the germans following us one of the Americans shouted									“WELCOME TO BASTOGNE!”							I was very good at school so I knew Bastogne was in Belgium we drove past their trenches and got off at the CP command post we were greeted by General Patton I cannot remember much of that part but I remember he told us that we would spend the rest of the war in peace and that we would get to go back to the states. So after all the difficult paperwork before I knew it, I was on a c-47 on my way back to America.							                	The war was over in europe on may 7th 1945 followed b V-J victory japan, on September 2nd 1945 which officially ended the second world war and letting us all go home from that horrible war. I found out that the place we were being held was a small wehrmacht camp. Our co pilot cooke was awarded the medal of honor because he helped the crew in the other part that I was not in escape. Well that&#39;s how I survived a b-17 crash and survived and a living in peace to this day. The man who shouted “ welcome to bastonge.” was corpral Eric Bodzack. I hoped you liked my story!

“HELP!” Olivia shouted.
“LITTLE BUSY!” Screamed Joey.
“OHH MY GOD!” BAM! With one last jolt the plane stopped and everyone was scared. Josh, Olivia, Beau, and Isabella were in a plane that had crashed somewhere they did not know of. 
“AHHHHHHH!” Beau screamed. 
“Beau, it stopped.” Said Olivia calmly. They were in the middle of an island and did not know what to do.
“Oh, I knew that.” Said Beau, clearly lying. 
“What do we do now?” Said isabella.
“No idea.” Josh said in reply. Olivia went to inspect the pilot. 
“Dead” She said in surprise. They got off the plane and went to inspect where they had landed. 
	“Lets see what we have to gather” Isabella said. They had a 2 liter water bottle, 4 dimes, a piece of gum, and a candy bar wrapper. 
	“Well that is SUPER helpful” said Josh.
	“Come on..” Replied Olivia. 
	“This has to be of some use” said Isabella.
	“We could use the candy wrapper as a food container, and the water to drink.” Said Olivia. They went to explore the island.
	“Ouch!” said Josh.
	“What is it said?” Olivia
	“I have a throbbing pain in my leg.”
	“Ok, maybe you need to stay here. I think you got hurt from the impact.” said Isabella. 
“Okay” replied Josh.
	“Beau and I will go into the forest to see if there is any food we could find” Olivia said. They were heading into the forest when they heard a noise.
&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
Chapter 2 - Monkeying Around\
&lt;/div&gt;

“What was that?” Said Olivia in fear. 
	“Probably just the wind” replied Beau. They kept walking when they heard it again until something jumped out at them. 
“AHHHH” screamed Olivia and Beau at the same time.
Right there in front of Olivia and Beau, was a little Emperor tamarin monkey. 
	“HAHA” laughed Beau. “Its a cute little monkey with a moustache!” Then, that “cute” little monkey jumped onto Beau’s head and started to rip his hair out!
“AHH STOP IT YOU LITTLE CREEP!” The monkey jumped off and left them alone but was not pleased.
“That was umm. Weird.” said Beau, clearly terrified.  they had walked a little bit farther and I finally found some delicious looking pink little fruits. 
“let&#39;s take them” said Beau
	“Okay” Olivia said. They had started to head back when the saw that little monkey again.
	“ Stay away you creep&quot; said Beau. The monkey was not appeased, but kept his distance. They got back when Isabella had wrapped Josh’s leg in some sort of green fuzzy stuff.
“What&#39;s on your leg?” Asked Beau.
	“Its Lambs ear.” said Isabella
	“EWW” said Beau “Why would you chop off a lamb’s ear and put it on his leg, and where did you get a lamb?”
	“Its a type of plant you idiot” said Josh. They had spent a few more hours just talking and creating a plan of what they were going to do while hopefully their parents were trying to find them. It was starting to get dark out and they were deciding what to do for the nighttime. 
	“I think we should stay in the plane where we are safe” said Josh.
“I’m fine with that,” said Isabella.
“Ditto” replied Beau
“Okay” Olivia agreed.

&lt;/div&gt;

	Everyone woke up the next morning feeling hungry and tired.
	“Mommy… Get me eggs and waffles.” said Beau with his eyes still closed.
	“Beau” said Josh “We are in the middle of an island from a plane crash and have no eggs and certainly no waffles.”
	“Darn it” Beau said. They got up and had some more berries they had saved from the night before and decided to do some more exploring when they heard another sound
“I swear if that monkey comes out I will strangle him” Beau threatened. It was a different sound from the monkey. A little fuzzball came out of the bushes. 
	“AWW” Everyone said in unison. It was a little puppy that they had found and was sitting there with its wide eyes and a tail that was going a million miles an hour. However, there was the little pups family and after numerous cuts, bites, and scrapes, they barely survive.
“Let&#39;s keep him” said Olivia.
“No” said Josh. “As cute as he is he is not tame. He is a wild wolf, not a puppy.” They walked back and as soon as they were settled in the plane, they heard scratching at the door. Josh went to open it and there sat the little wolf and he pranced into the plane.
“AWW” everyone said. The little pup came and snuggled with them and curled up into Olivia’s lap.

Chapter 4 - Giving up Hope\
&lt;/div&gt;
	It had been a week, and everyone was tired, and there was no food, and the little wolf that would not leave Olivia’s side was real grumpy from the lack of food and water. 
	“I wonder if anyone is even looking for us.” Said Beau.
	“I bet so, I mean, we are in the middle of nowhere.” Said Isabella. They decided to leave the plane and take the little pup to go to the bathroom and take him on a walk. 
	“Lets split up.” Said Isabella. “Josh and I will continue taking the pup for a walk while you and Beau go and look for some type of food.” Beau and Olivia finally found the same berry bush as before and take some berries before the sassy monkey returns.  They get back and after food, everyone is feeling better. They teach the pup some tricks, including how to roll over, beg, and sit. They all enjoy each others company while they wait for rescue.

Chapter 5 - The Rescue\
&lt;/div&gt;
After 7 months of learning how to live in the wild, a lot of things had changed. For 1, the little pup had really become tame, and was amazing at fetch, doing tricks, and was the most loyal out of Josh, Isabella, Olivia, and Beau. Even when they all got in fights, the little guy was always there to comfort each and everyone of them. Another thing that was different was the 4 friends. They had become aware of how valuable everyone of them was. They all appreciated having each other around, after living with each other for 7 months. They had also learned how to get food, and water. They had each made spears, and would fish out on the beach out towards the reefs while the pup would splash and swim. Everything had really changed and each of them had decided that no matter how long they were on that island, that they would love each other for who they were and valued each others skills, and talents. 

One morning, they all had awoke to the little pup barking at something through the window and they had all realized, it was an engine of a helicopter! They had all raced out of the plane and looked up to see a ladder headed out of the helicopter and each one of them had climbed on including the little pup. They were so grateful and were  so happy to get of that island.

Chapter 6 - Home at Last\
&lt;/div&gt;
	They had all been in a hospital for a week so they could be checked for any diseases and the pup so he could officially be tamed. 
	“Hi mommy.” Said Olivia waking up from her 3 hour nap.
	“Hi baby girl” Said Olivia’s mom and dad. “We brought you something.” They said. They had whistled and in  came the little pup from the island. “What are you going to name him?” Her mom asked.
	“His name is Harou, it means wolf of the army” She said. The little pup  jumped on her and licked her face. They had finally got to go home and for weeks Olivia, Josh, Isabella, and Beau had lots of stories to tell their families and as for Harou, he is to this day the most spoiled little puppy along with his adopted sister, Ama, which means water in Cherokee. They all had learned a very important lesson that day. Love others.

Hi I’m Ian and I thought today was gonna be just like any other day, just me and my dog, at the beach. But it wasn&#39;t.

Cody, my dog,  and I love going on walks across the beach just to find the perfect spot to stop and look at the waves. It such a beautiful day outside, nice and sunny with a little brez; it couldn’t get any better. Oh wait, it just got better, I can see dolphins that are semi close to the shore they are just diving and then emerging repeating that constantly. Then of course Cody saw them and is starting to bark, I look at him and then I start rubbing him; knowing him he rolls over and keeps hitting my arm with his paw. I laugh and then rub him some more. 

Then my best friend Roman walks up with a bunch of dogs; 

I look at him confused and he tells me, “I started a dog walking business, my schedule is completely packed, apparently the word got around quickly.” 
I smile at him and say, “I’m so glad for you, but what are you doing on the beach?” 
Then he continued to tell me that, “I tried a bunch of places to walk the dogs and they like the beach the best.” 
Well I mean that does make sense i mean, look at Cody he loves the beach. 
Roman told me,”Well I have to go return all these dogs to their owners, bye.”		 I wave bye to him and go back to looking at the waves. </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="46" name="Pierce L." tags="" position="251,1336" size="100,100">&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\

On a rainy day when I was driving to work the ground started shaking and I said,” I think there’s an earthquake, I don’t think I should go to work today.” 10 minutes later, I was driving home and the ground started shaking even more. I got hit by a tiny meteor from my left and I was knocked out. 1 hour later, I woke up and the whole city was on fire and there were meteors everywhere and I said,” I am going to die today.”

I kept driving and I found a broken down house in this strange neighborhood and I walked in and in the dining room, there was a bed and a couch. I stayed there for the night.*The next day. I woke up and walked out of the broken down house. It was chaos in the town of san francisco, because lots of people were dead, and lots of people had left San Francisco.  I saw a car and I got in it, I drove to the Golden Gate Bridge and it was broken, so I couldn’t get past! I looked below me and I saw a boat. So, I drove down there and got on the boat and found keys under the seat of the boat.  I drove the boat around a lot to try and help injured people. One injured guy turned out to be my brother!  I was so happy to find him alive! “I thought you were in college in Florida?” I said.
“I came to visit but got hit by a meteor!” my brother exclaimed.  We drove away and I set a destination to Utah where I could take my brother to the hospital. We  drove away forever. The End.

Winter came in like a cold blanket across the land, a big white blanket covering everything. But I would soon learn how beautiful but deadly winter could be. Every year I had to go 4-wheeling before it got too cold, I needed the adrenaline before it got colder. All I had time to do is get firewood that&#39;s all I ever had time to do when it was cold. So until 4-wheeling to the trail, Gabriel got on his 4-wheeler, but he was 13, and on winter break, so he just didn&#39;t care. He just went out and 4-wheeled into the woods. He would soon realize his grave mistake. He put his machete on his belt (for protection) and headed off to go 4-wheeling in the woods.

 As he was driving in the woods, he saw birds, elk, and moose, he knew it would bring sorrow when winter ended the woods were beautiful but he drove on. After a while I turned back then I realized I&#39;ve never gone this far on this dirt road, so I just followed the road back to my house, but I came across a split in the road left or right I&#39;ll flip a coin heads I go right tails I go left 3. 2. 1. Its tails left I went I think I&#39;ll put a sign here when I get back home. Gabriel veered left and drove down the rocky road, after a mile or two the 4-wheeler had stopped and he didn&#39;t know why, so he looked at how much gas he had left he then realized he had none. So he got off his 4-wheeler and started walking because Gabriel thought he was going the right way, after a while, he realized he was going the wrong way. He thought he could just look down and his tracks would be in the snow. As he thought so, they were there, so he followed them back. As he was walking he looked down and realized that it had snowed cover his tracks, and then he realized he was lost, it was getting colder, the sun was setting, and Gabriel only had a brief knowledge of survival. He knew he would need to find a lake or some water source, he saw a lake on the walk back so he followed his tracks until he saw the lake. Now at the lake, the next issue was a shelter, he needed somewhere to sleep, somewhere to keep out of the elements. Gabriel knew how to build a lean-to against a tree, he also knew that it took time, but he needed shelter and it looked like a blizzard was coming, and fast so he took out his machete and went to a big tree. Then he started cutting off branches after Gabriel cut off about 20 good-sized branches, he leaned the branches against a large tree with no limbs at the bottom but has thick pine needles at the top. Then he cut some branches off of a pine tree (for carpet and installation) so after that Gabriel set the good-sized branches up against the tree and put the smaller branches with the pine needles still on them on top of the shelter.

 The way he tested if it was good is by throwing snow onto it, if the snow didn&#39;t go through he would throw water on it the water would go through so he mixed sticks and mud together, and put it on there to waterproof it, then he stepped back to look at his work and to also throw snow and water on Gabriel went into the lean-to and saw that the water did not leak through the lean-to and it didn&#39;t collapse from the weight of the snow. Gabriel thought that he had somewhere to sleep, now he has to make warmth, all this knowledge of survival and how to build a lean-to shelter came from books. He had read tons of books about survival because when he graduated high school, he wanted to go to the woods, he wanted to just, walk into the woods with his gear and go and build his own house and live there with no electricity. He thought that this was his chance so he worked happily, but he needed a fire, then he remembered he keeps a lighter in his pocket. He needed firewood Gabriel went into the woods and broke some twigs, got some dead leaves and pine needles for a bundle pack. Then he got some good-sized logs and branches so his fire would keep going for longer. He went back to camp and light the bundle pack about two feet from the lean-to, then he put the smaller branches on then the bigger branches, then the logs and after about an hour of adding firewood and blowing on the fire he had a good warm fire. He then realized that he wanted to live out here, he would have to go back to his cabin

  Gabriel thought that this probably wasn&#39;t a good place to live. He wanted to build a cabin, but he would like to build it, somewhere better like Alaska. He would need tools, so even though it denied what he wanted, he needed to go back, so he could fly to Alaska he would have to fly to Alaska and get the tools. There was so much he needed that he didn&#39;t have but this is something to think about for tomorrow, Gabriel slowly dozed off and in the morning the fire was out and he wanted to try and go home. So he set off into the woods, hoping he was going the right way as Gabriel was walking he saw a deer and got lost in the sound of the birds singing so he just kept walking and he walked until he was so hungry that he couldn&#39;t walk anymore, he then looked around and realized that the cabin was farther. He saw some cattails and remembered that you can eat the inside. So he broke one open and ate it. He took a couple more and put them in his pocket for later than Gabriel kept walking thinking that he was going in the right direction. Not knowing that he had crossed the border from Montana into Canada and but he didn&#39;t know so he kept walking, putting S.O.S signs every clearing and on the third one a bush plane flew by and saved him.” Goodbye, goodbye till next time!” Gabriel yells.

“Come on grab your bags and get off the bus!” Yelled Benny.
“ OKAY, OKAY were coming” replied the rest of the team. 
“We have to get to the plane or else we’ll be late,” said Dave. 
“We just won the biggest championship in lacrosse,” said Robert, “Can’t you give us a break!?!” 
“We don’t have time for, just a break,” Benny frustratedly replied. “As tired and exhausted as you are, we just can’t be late” Benny could hardly imagine what would happen if they lost their apartments. In his mind kept running the fear that,  if we&#39;re late then we’re late for the conference, and we’ll lose our apartment complex in Denver. 
“Fine then, what do you want us to do run the rest of the way there?” said Robert. 
“I was just going to make you guys speed walk or jog but running works!” Said Benny. 
“Ah great” “Thanks a lot Robert,” said the rest of the team.  
“You are truly welcome,” said Robert in a sarcastic voice. 
“Less chit chat, more running!!!” yelled Benny over the angry team. 

	As the team mounted the plane and took their seats the voice of the pilot came on, 
	“This is your pilot speaking, please find a seat and buckle your seat belts because we will be in the air in &#39;&#39;THREE&#39;&#39; minutes.”
	“Finally” or “About time” murmured the rest of the team. 
	Just as Benny sat down in his soft, comforting chair the plane took off into the dark night sky. Then once they were all evened out and flying straight ahead there was a loud ding signaling that they could get up and move or go to the bathroom.

&lt;/div&gt; 

	As Tony relaxed and put on his headphones the plane made a violent jerk down and made a big “CRRRACK” noise. 5 seconds later the pilot&#39;s voice came booming over the speaker, 
	“HEADS DOWN AND BRACE FOR IMPACT, WE RE GOING FOR A CRASH LANDING IN A SMALL CLEARING IN THE FOREST!! THE RIGHT-WING ALMOST SPLIT IN TWO!!!” 
	The team immediate followed directions and ducked down. Once their heads were down there was a quiet chatter between the teammates, “What just happened?” or “will we make it home, will we be okay?” 
	“We’ll be okay, just listen to what the pilot says,” said Benny. 
	“Yea what Benny said,” Dave mumbled. 
	
	The pilot tried putting down the landing gears, but they didn’t work so he improvised and evened out the plane so that it would make a smooth landing. 
	“3, 2, 1, BRACE FOR IMPACT,” the co-pilot said as the plane crashed to the ground. 
	“That wasn’t so bad,” said Tony.
	“Yea” Benny replied. 
	All of a  sudden the plane jerked down because the good wing that had supported it had fallen off and the left side of the plane crashed to the ground. 
	“Ahhh” Robert yelled in pain, “My arm’s stuck in between the seat and the window” 
	“How in the world did that happen?” Jack asked questioning why Robert sounded hurt.
“The seat came off its hinges and it’s crushing my arm,” Robert said.
“Welll then stop standing around and help him!” Benny said.
“On it!” Tony said, and in a matter of seconds, he had Roberts arm out. 


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    4 hours later \
&lt;/div&gt;  

	“Put the log down, at right about...Here” Benny said as he dropped the last log into place. In the past 3 hours, the team had been building a cabin for shelter because of the fact that the plane could no longer help them, because of the heavy damage done.  
	“How’s that sling holding up?” Tony asked Robert. 
	“It&#39;s great, but I still don’t think that I broke my arm” Robert replied. “I wish I could have helped build the shelter but, YOU WOULDN’T LET ME!!!” He said angerly. 
	“Do any of you guys hear that noise coming from the woods?” Benny asked questioning what he had just heard. 
	“It sounds like a bear,” Robert said. 
	“Uh oh,” Tony said in a humorous voice. 
“Grab your lacrosse sticks and throw balls because they&#39;re the only defense we have!” Benny ordered.
Just as the team grabbed their sticks the bear came running out of the woods. 
“Fire!” Benny yelled as all of the balls started flying at 80-90 miles per hour, all towards the bear. 
“Let him have it!” Robert said excitedly. 
The team cheered as the bear fell unconscious. 
“Let&#39;s Go!!!” the team cheered. 
“Great job, but have any of you guys noticed that the wind keeps gaining speed?” Tony asked. 
“Yea and those DARK clouds over there look dangerous,” Benny replied.
“We should finish the shelter,” Robert said in a perswading voice. 
“Well then stop standing around and let&#39;s get to work,” the pilot said.
“One last thing, did you ever tell us your name?” Benny asked.
“Sorry I did not, names Grant,” the pilot said.
“Nice to meet you, now let’s work!” Tony said. 
“For the shelter, we could use the bolts from the plane and use a stick like a baton and bolt them in,” Benny said.
“Good Idea, let&#39;s do it!.” Robert said.

It took a long time but eventually the tame made a log cabin with such a good foundation that it could survive 190 mile per hour winds but the wind and the dark clouds kept coming closer and faster. 
“I think that this isn’t an ordinary storm,” Benny said worriedly. 
“Yea, we should take shelter in the cabin,” Tony suggested “It doesn&#39;t look that safe” 
“We should build a fire, for heat!” Robert said excitedly.
“And get this place full of smoke, NO THANKS!” Tony replied. 
“FINE,” Robert said.

That&#39;s when the rain started, beating against the cabin. 
“However bad this storm is, it’s starting whether you like it or not.” Said Grant. 
“Let&#39;s hope the shelter holds,” Benny said as the winds gained speed. 
“Yea,” said Tony.


&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    3 hours later \
&lt;/div&gt;  

“Well I ran out to the plane and got the radio working, and it sounds like Benny was right. It is not an ordinary storm...It was a hurricane.” Grant said nervously.
“Well that&#39;s great,” said Robert sarcastically. 
	“I think that it&#39;s pretty small because it&#39;s getting really calm so it must be ending soon,” said Benny.
	“Yea, we must have got the outside or the after storm of it.” Said, Tony.
	“Well whatever it was it’s over now,” said Robert. 

	As the team talked about the hurricane Grant heard something weird, something that he thought wasn’t real but little does he know, it was. 

	“Do any of you guys hear that noise?” Grant asked curiously. 
	Then everyone hushed and listened closely. 
	“Is that a...Helicopter!” Robert said excitedly.
	“Hurry get outside we have to make sure they see us,” Benny said urgently.
	And sure enough, as the team ran out of the cabin they saw 4 bright orange helicopters. 
	“Were here!!!” and “Over here!!” the team shouted as loud as the could. 
	“They&#39;re turning back towards us!” said Benny excitedly.

	The helicopters landed, got everyone on board, and gave medical treatment to Roberts&#39;s arm. Later the helicopter landed in San Diego and the team made it to their conference back in Denver. They got to keep the complex, and they think everything is back to normal but little do they know, the issue only got worse.

Once upon a time, there was a lonely young princess sitting in her room with her pet bunny Timothy. The princess&#39;s name was Annabele. She was a beautiful sight, long curly golden blond hair that was as golden as the sun, silky pink dress that flowed like a river down a canyon, diamond increased jewelry that shone like the moon in the night sky, and a face of an angel. But there was one flaw about her, she never smiled. The reason for this was because of her parents, The King and Queen of  Clanendell (claire-en-dail).
 The King and Queen were always out of town and never spent any quality time with Annabele when they were home for their short periods of time. Annabele was done with not being seen, she decided right there on the spot that she would go to Hunnydiel, find her parents working with King Richard The First and Queen Allena The First  (the Queen and King of Hunnydiel). She would go up to her parents and say that she was tired of not being seen..., in a way that wasn&#39;t going to get her thrown in jail.
 Annabele told her servant about what she wanted to do, and the servant, Bill, thoroughly aged with her. He believed that Annabele&#39;s parents did not spend any time with her. He agreed to fly her to Hunnydiel. 
The ride on the private jet was peaceful until the gear locked and Bill could not steer, the plane was going down fast. The clouds became just a white blur. Annabele was terrified, Bill’s familiar voice came on the intercom 
“Annabele, stay calm everything going to be ok. Just stay calm.”Annabele wanted to believe him but she couldn&#39;t. Then everything went black.         
When Annabele woke she felt a searing pain in her right shoulder all the way up to her head. She tried to sit up but she just couldn&#39;t. She heard bills voice. Somehow it soothed her she sat up. She saw a blurry bill
“What happened?” she asked.
“Well… the plane crashed and all we have to survive is a plane full of things we have yet to find,” Bill replied.
“What!!” The thought struck Annabele like a punch in the gut. She and Bill were stranded in the middle of nowhere with almost nothing to survive.
“ What… But...How..?”Annabele studdard
“Bill, are you telling me that we are stranded in the middle of nowhere  and we have to survive until someone comes and rescues us ?”Annabele questioned him.
“Well…..yes, ” Bill replied and then went into the crashed plane to look for supplies to help them survive. Annabele left alone in the wilderness because of her headache.  After 30 minutes of searching, Bill found the survival kit and brought it out of the crashed plane and went over to where Annabele. The kit contained a first aid kit, a hunting knife, a rifle, pots and pans, matches, a flare, and some dehydrated food.
“ Luxurious,”  Annabele said sarcastically.
“ Let&#39;s start to build a shelter for tonight,” Bill said nervously.
“OK….. how do we do it?” Annabele asked.
“That&#39;s the thing... I don&#39;t know how,” Bill said looking down at his shiny black shoes.
“Well let&#39;s try,” Annabele said with a can-do attitude.
“First let&#39;s find a bunch of sticks and then try to stand them all up against a tree,” Annabele said. 
Since her headache was feeling better, Annabele helped Bill look for sticks. Bill lifted the heavy ones and Annabele collected twigs to fill in the cracks. Bill found a tree that had lots of branches and he started to stack all the heavy logs on some strong branches of the tree. When all the logs were secure Annable put twigs in between the logs to secure the shelter. The shelter took them almost the whole day to complete. 
“I don’t think we could have done better,” Bill said confidently.
“We did do good,” Annabele said still not smiling, she was thinking of her parents. Did they know Bill and her had gone missing? Did they care?
“We better get some rest,” Bill said and Annabele nodded. They both crawled in the shelter.
“We will think of something for food and water tomorrow, but we need our rest,” Bill said.  Annabele could not sleep, she was worried about everything, Timmothy, her bunny, that she left at home, herself and even Bill.  She hoped that she would survive. 
Then she heard it, it was like footsteps, but also a sound like leaves being swirled around. She is perplexed because the night was as still as a trunk of a tree. She stayed up all night thinking of that noise. What was it?
 The next day  Annabele felt someone was following her when Bill and her went looking for a lake or some other source of water. 	
All of a sudden an evil crazy-haired tree popped out of nowhere. Annabele and Bill were absolutely terrified. She grabbed the first thing she saw: a stick.  Annabele threw the stick at the tree. To Annabele’s suprise the stick became part of the tree! 
The tree  (With an extra arm) said, “I’ve had enough of you in MY forest! I’m prepared to battle you”.  Then all of a sudden the tree grabbed Bill and put him in his spiky leaves. The tree branches were really sharp and the tree started poking Annabelle. 
Then Annabele released that she had the superpower, ARMS. She started grabbing at the branches of the tree. She missed a few then got a grip on one of them, she pulled with all her might and the branch detached from the tree. Then she ran, when the tree caught up to her she pulled another branch then continued running. Over and over that happened. 
 When she pulled the last branch the tree fell,  Annabele did not know if it was dead or not. She stuck her hand in the spiky branches and felt a hand. She grabbed that hand and pulled with all her might. Bill came stumbling out.
“Are you okay?” Annabele asked.
“Yes I’m ok,” Bill replies.
“Is he dead?” Bill asks pointing to the tree.
“I don&#39;t know,” Annabele said nervously. 
So they ran, they ran faster and faster. Until they came to a clearing, and in that clearing, there was a town. Annabele saw a sign that read “ Welcome To  Hunnydiel”. Then out of the corner of her eye she saw her parents, the king and queen, running to her, and for that moment she felt seen. A slow smile spread across her face, and that was the first time in a very long time that she smiled. It wouldn&#39;t be the last.

It was a blistering day in the Amazon rainforest and my touring group was going on a 12:00 walk. My best friends and I were in the back of the group as usual. I saw this beautiful flower on the side of the trail, I bent over to look at it. My friends took a gander. It felt like a few seconds but when I looked up the rest of the group was gone. All of my friends were as puzzled as me. I began to call out people&#39;s names, but no response. Now my fear begins to bubble like crispy bacon. I look at my friends and Bob is hugging Avery while Avery is crying. I tell her everything will be okay. But deep down I don’t even know if everything will be alright. Well now it&#39;s been around 10 to 15 minutes. I tell my friends we need a plan. Bob says “Okay I will get food”. Christopher Rob says”Okay I will help make a fire”. Avery says” I will make a tent”. Okay sounds like a good plan. I will go find a good place to camp. Bob go find some food come back here when your done. Rest of use will go find shelter.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    3 Hours Later\
&lt;/div&gt;  

	Now it&#39;s 3:17. “Avery good job on making the tent, and Christopher good job making a fire,” I said. Has anyone seen Bob lately he has been gone for a while now. Avery go find him and bring him back. Now we need to wait for them to come back. Avery screams loudly“ WE NEED TO ROAST MARSHMELLO&#39;S NOW”. I tell Avery “We don’t have marshmello’s”. As soon as I say that I know I messed up. She flips out and I means she FLIPS OUT. She starts to scream and scream. I try to calm her but she doesn’t stop. I remember that I had some crushed crackers in my back pocket. I pull them out like Usain Bolt and I throw them at her and hit her square in the head.

Now we’re about 3 feet away from each other, without saying anything she starts to run at me with all her might like a full grown bull. She hits me like a freight train straight to my stomach. All the lights go dark and then back on, and now everyone is around me.  


				&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    4 Hours Later\
&lt;/div&gt;  

	Now it’s 7:17 and Avery returned. She told us some bad news “ Bob fell off a cliff and in severe pain”. I say in response “ We must go back and get him”. But Christopher yells “ THE FIGHT OF THE FITTEST”. Avery said in a calm voice, “This is not a Game Of Thrones” 
Because I am the most responsible person here, I go with Avery to find Bob. Before I leave I say in a sarcastic voice don’t hurt yourself like Bob.
Well now we must go and find a lost friend.


				&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    The Steep Cliff\
&lt;/div&gt;  
	We have been walking in a straight line, the sun has gone down but still no Bob. I ask Avery” Are we there yet”. She Replies with an angrily “NO AND STOP ASKING”. We continue walking eventually we stumble upon this cliff. We look down and see Bob just sitting there. We yell his name and replies with a clam normal voice” Oh hey guys what you doin up there”. We yell back“stay there”. We eventually get down there and grab Bob. We manage to get back up with the extra weight of Bob. All of us start heading back thanks to Avery&#39;s compass. While we were walking back we stumbled upon an abandoned house. We all agreed that we will come back here after getting Christphore.

		
			&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    The Abandoned House\
&lt;/div&gt; 
As soon as I saw Christphore I said” Bro come check this out”. All 4 of use ran straight for the house that was so called “abandoned”. We first knocked on the front door like a kind person. To our surprise there was an old lady. She welcomes us in and ask “Would you like some cookies there almost done”. I Politely said yes, and she went and brought some out. After a little time talking I told her the story about use getting lost. She said in a New York type of talk”Yeah I know why you asking”. I responded, “ Well we really want to get back home.&#39;&#39; She grabbed a piece of paper and handed it to me. Turns out it was a map to the local city. After giving it to she said “Stay safe”. We begin to start our trip.

				&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    The Dark Sky\
&lt;/div&gt; 
By the time we got to our hotel where we are staying at the sun had already gone down and it was 12:34 in the afternoon. As soon as I sink my teeth into that wonderful, juicy chicken I felt like I was in heaven.

&lt;/div&gt;

On a small Island off the coast of florida called the Cedar Key island there was a boy named Jack. Jack was 13 years old and had blonde hair. He lived with his mom and 2 sisters his dad was sent to jail for theft , but Jack had stopped his father from robbing the bank by popping the tiers on his getaway car with the pocket knife he got for his 9th birthday. It has been 3 years since he had seen his dad, and Jack wants to see him but doesn&#39;t have the courage to talk to him face to face after what he did. 








&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 1\
&lt;/div&gt;

	“COME ON JACK IT IS TIME FOR SCHOOL!” 
	“OK COMING!” I say back down
	I rushed down stairs and shove all my cereal in my mouth and run out the door.
	“ don’t forget your homework Jack.” My mom says
	I stop with a screech on the tile and run to my mom. 
“thank you bye!”
“Love you see you after school, and no dili daling!”
“Ok mom!”

Hi my name is Jack and I am 13 years old and go to coconut view middle school on an island off the coast of florida. My dad has been in jail for at least 3 years and he still has 2 more to go, and when he gets out he better not be crawling back to us. 

As I arrive to school I imdeiatly avert my eyes from Ted the school bully. I would stand up to him if I were brave enough and strong off. But I am neither of those so that is a problem, and I don’t care about who he is bullying as long as it is not me. As I arrive in my history class I look around go go find my seat, but right before I sat down I get jumped from behind and thrown to the ground and I think this is it please tell my mom I love her 
“Dude it is Just me, and you also said all of that out loud.” I recognize that voice! I say to myself.
“ Todd!”
“ Hey buddy!” He says to me
Todd has been my only friend since I moved here from Colorado. I still miss that place
“ How has it been bro?”
“ You know same old same old, walk the dog, do the dishes and stuff like that.” 
“Cool” Todd says
“ can you hang after school maybe or over the weekend?” He asks
“ Maybe, I will have to check my schedule.” I respond
“ Ok, well see you after class, bye”
“ See ya!”
As I see him leave I wonder if I will ever get more friends. But I didn&#39;t let that get me down through out class I was thinking about Todd and what I would do if he left or didn’t want to  be my friend. 
“ JACK” The teacher yells
“ Yes” I say
“ What is the answer.” He asks me 
“ 42?”  The class gave a little chuckle as the bell rings.
“ Remember pages 132, and 140 in your history books. And I expect to see a full essay.” The whole class lets out an angry sigh.
“ Yes I know the big bad history teacher giving you homework. Hey Jack, come here I need to speak with you.” I walk over and look at him, he looks like he is staring into my soul.
A short period of time goes bye before he finally says something.
	“ Look I know it has been hard with your father gone and I bet your mother is stressed with 3 kids. But you need to focus in class, this daydreaming in class is not ok. Here give my number to your mother.” He looks in his desk and grabs a sticky note and starts to srible.
*RIP* 
“Here you go make sure to give this to her, we have had a long overdue talk. You can go to know”
I start to walk when I here 
“WAIT!” He yells
“ If you want, I can also help you study, I was once a tutor myself.”
“OkI will give it a thought.”
“ My office hours are from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM”
“ Ok bye” I say
“ See you tomorrow” He says back
As I walk in the halls on my way to math I wonder 
Should I go or not? Because it really looked like he wanted to help it really did.

    Chapter 2\
&lt;/div&gt;
	Once I get out of school I started to walk home when I hear something in the bush so I get a little closer to see what it was when I saw it. I saw a neon backpack in the bush and I remembered “THAT IS TED’S BACKPACK!”
So I started to run and look behind me and I see ted and his friends jumping out of the bush. But when I was looking behind me I didn’t see the tree. I slammed my face into the tree and all I could see was blood on my hands. But I wouldn’t let that stop me so I tried to get up but my legs felt like jello so I started to wobble and I fell down the hill on my left. But somehow I managed to hit every rock I could possibly hit. When I make it to the bottom I look up and all I see Ted and his friends looking down and hear him say.
“ Let’s go we do much to him know. He is already too bloody to do anything else.”
Then my whole world went black.

Then I saw a big white light in my face and a man with a deep voice saying 
“You think he is dead?”
“NO! his eyes are open you dumbo” The second man says
“I’m not dead” I say in a weak raspy voice
“Told you know let’s get some backup”
Then I see a big red light and a loud siren. That is all I remember.
But after about 5 minutes of sitting in the hospital bed my mom and my 2 sisters walked in
“WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU!” she says with a high pitched squeal
“ I WAS WORRIED SICK!” 
“Sorry mom” I say to her she looks at me with a warm smile and says.
“How did this happen?” She asks so I tell her the story of what happened.
“Wow, so Ted did this to you technically?”
“No it was my fault for not looking forward”
“Alright, let’s get you home”
I had to have a wheelchair so that was kinda annoying. But once I made it home I was told to rest on the couch and not move. I also couldn’t go to school for the next few days that was the only benefit. When the day came that I could go to school I was kinda excited I haven’t seen Todd in days so that would be pretty cool. 

So the next morning I got up and tried to walk and finally it wasn’t blurry. But Right before I went to school I heard something. A big siren and I thought it was a cop car or something but when my mom heard it she froze and yelled at us to
“GET INSIDE”
That was when I remembered that sound was it was the bombing alarm. For the first time we were getting bombed. I immediately rushed inside and we ran to the living room and I was heading towards the basement door when it hit. The bomb hit our house and everything went black again. Then in a sudden instance i woke up sweating and my leg hurt badly. But I was still alive which is good, but I don’t know if my family is alive so I shout their names.
“MOM, MIRANDA,LAFONDA! ARE ANY OF YOU GUYS ALIVE”
No response which means their not with me anymore, so it is just me against the world. But I can&#39;t worry about that know I first have to figure out how to get out of this mess. So I look to my left then to my right, then I look at my leg it was burned and bruised all over but I will live… Hopefully. I start to move some rubble and I still can’t see anything but dust, wood, and rocks. But I keep trying to get out and I have at least been in the ruble for about an hour and the thirst is really starting to hit me. As strang to get out my mouth feels like sandpaper and my leg is bleeding all over I need to get to the hospital. 



&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    1 Hour Later\
&lt;/div&gt;

I can’t die like this i say to myself and I look around and notice a shine that hits me in the eye. Wait if the only way to get shine is sunlight then! I can get out! I crawled over to the metal object and see it is a poker for the fireplace. I grab it and start stabbing at the wood and finally it gives and the wood falls so I start to crawl out and I see the sun. That is all just the sun no buildings just the sun. I look around and I never notice all the trees, well what is left of them. I start to walk when I step on something. I look down and see a face looking at me, I immediately look up but before I do I see the man had a sachle so I pick it up and see what it has. It’s contents are a knife, water,books, and a fire starter. I couldn’t believe what I found. In my happiness I remember that I am all alone. So with my new found items I start to head towards the trees to go make a shelter but then. I see some ruble moving and I go and investigate. As I get closer and closer I see it shows a saying of struggle so it might be a wild animal, and if it is then I can get an easy kill with my knife. I get closer and get out my knife and see it’s stuck under rubble and I think. Now is my chance. So I jump out and see it is Todd under the ruble. 
“Todd is that you!?” I say 
“Jack is that you!” Todd says
“Yes it is, oooh I&#39;m so happy that I am not the only one! I would have been so lonely”
“That is very heartwarming but can you please help get this stuff off of me!”
“Oh yeah let me help.” I start to get all the stuff off of him and he doesn&#39;t look hurt but then I remember that I am hurt. 
“So where do we go?” he asks me
“ We try to find some medical place we can go to care for our wounds” I say 

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 3\
&lt;/div&gt;
	Todd and I started to walk in the direction of the hospital. It took us about 30 minutes to get their but lucky for us about half of it is still standing. So we start to go into the half that is still standing and grab some bandages and some ointment. After we applied the medical stuff to our wounds we start to head to the forest to make a shelter and find food. If there&#39;s any left. When started to walk I was looking at the ocean when I saw the Jail they had kept my father in for all those years. 
“Hey” says Todd
“If you ever need to talk about it I am right here”
“Thanks Todd, I am so happy I have a friend like you”
When we start to walk away from the jail that after the bombing is a bunch of ruins. Then we here a big “ZIP” something had gone by jacks hip. They both whipped around and saw a man on one of the big hills with a big trench coat and a gas mask on so they couldn’t see who it was. They started to run as he fired again and again and again until they ran into the nearby woods so he couldn&#39;t see them.
“WHO WAS THAT GUY!?” asks Todd
“ I don’t know but he doesn&#39;t seem to like me all that much”  I say
“Well what should we do?” Todd asks
“We should find fresh water, food, and shelter,” I tell him
“I will go and find fresh water and food, you will stay and build a shelter for the night, oh hear you go.” I through him the fire starter and say
“By the time I get back you should make a fire, Bye see you later”
“Bye and be safe!” yells Todd
“I will Bye!”
Where should I look first I tell myself. Well the ruble is that way so I should go this way!
As I start to walk, I think about what I should do If I run into that guy again. I chose not to think about it because I would be so worried about focusing on him that I wouldn&#39;t be focusing on food and water. As soon as I said that I hear the snap of a branch in front of me. I immediately duck behind a bush and see a baby deer come out of the bush and i though. Finally a real animal I can eat. I start to move very slowly then I jumped out and stabbed it in the sied and killed it. After I prayed for its sole and aid it was for a good cause. 
When I made it back Todd did exactly what I said he had a warm fire going and told me he found a source of water. So we were all good. For the next few days, and it was getting kinda dark so after we ate we went to bed. 








&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 4\
&lt;/div&gt;
	The next morning we woke up to the sound of a snapping sticks. At first I thought it was an animal until I saw that the so called animal was carrying a shotgun. Then I realized it was the man so I quickly woke Todd up and we ran into the trees as silently as possible. Then the man walked over and started to inspect our campsite and tried to look for us. That is when Todd said.
“Give me your knife” in a whisper
“Why?”
“Just give it”
I give Todd my knife and he looks at the man with a determined face. I immediately know what he is thinking.
“DON’T YOU DARE TRY.”
But before I could finish he sprang at him and cut the man&#39;s hip open with the knife. The man howled in pain  as we ran from him we could hear him coming after us. We didn’t dare to look back as for fear he would be close but finally with what felt like hours we got away from him. But the bad luck did not end there. We sood realized we left everything but the knife back at the base were the man was. So the night was going to be a very long one and a very cold one. I tried to find food but all that I could find was a few dozen berries which lasted about 30 minutes before we were all out. So once we ran out of berries we tried to fall asleep. It was hard with the cold night but eventually I fell asleep. The next day came to quickly and Todd and I need to find some way off the island because we can’t keep running forever.

	The first thing we did was find food, again there wasn&#39;t much food left after the attack so we mostly ate berries. When I was trying to make a fire I heard Todd scream.
“HELP JACK PLEASE!” I rushed over to his voice and I see a big black bear him pinning him up in a corner. The bear heard me and turns around I run over to Todd him and say.
“Let me get on your shoulders!”
“What? Why?”
“Just let me do it!” 
“Ok fine” Todd bends down and lets me get on top of his shoulders and I start yelling Todd starts to yell too and soon the bear runs off.
“How did you know to do that?”
I remember my dad telling me that always be bigger than a black bear.” I was looking around and that is when I saw it. Over one tree I saw a control tower for telling plans they could land but it hasn&#39;t been used in years. 
“TODD I SEE A CONTROL TOWER MAYBE WE CAN USE IT TO GET HELP!” I say to him
“Well let&#39;s go then!”



	He puts me down and we start walking. We start heading west towards the mountain where I saw the tower and eventually in about 2 hours we make it their.
	“ I’m so hungry and tired” I hear Todd say
	“Yeah me to” I reponed
	“So do you think this still works?” Todd asks me
	“I mean maybe” 
We look at it for a little bit then I stand up and try to get it working.
	“Wow this thing is so old it doesn&#39;t even turn on”
	“Or you just need to turn on the power”
I look at him and he is right next to a big switch that says. CAUTION KEEP AWAY FROM FLAMMABLE ITEMS OR CLOTHING. I look at him and smile
	“Make sure to be careful” I tell him
	“ Don’t worry I will be” 
He looks at the switch and gets closer than flicks it. The box made a loud sound then a whirring noise next thing I know all the light bulbs explode but that doesn&#39;t matter because it is day. Then the radio turns on and we only hear static. 
	“Do you know any emergency channels I can go to?” I ask Todd
	“I think so try 9.11”
	“That&#39;s smart why didn’t I try that” 
I go to the chanel and I say.
	“Can anyone hear me, we are on cedar key island and we have been bombed and so far we are the only survivors” 
That is when I remembered then man in the mask.
“Does anyone hear me?!” 
Still no answer until.
	“Hello you said you were on cedar key island?”
I look at Todd with the biggest smile on my face and say.
	“Yes, that is correct”
	“Alright we will send a dispatch team to the north part of the island we will be their in about 5 hours.”
	“Ok that is fine with us”
	“Alright see you then over and out”
Then more static Todd looks at me and we start jumping and yelling with joy Then he says.
	“We should get going it will take us at least 3 hours to get to the beach”
	“ Your right and on the way to get food and water”
We start to head out and we decide to take some of the glass and use it to make a spear along with the dental floss we took from the hospital. Once we get to the north beach we hid just in case we see the man again. About 30 minutes pass bye when we see the ship.
	“Wow their early”
	“Yes we will finally get off this island!”
As the boat gets closer I wonder what I am going to do when we leave since my whole family is gone. But then I heard another boom but it seemed really close. I turn around and Todd was on the ground. I look past him and I see the man, I immediately duck down and grabbed a rock. I stood up and through it at his head. It hit him and when he looked back at me, he was bleeding and the rock went through his mask. I rushed him like Todd did last time and he fired but he missed when we were wrestling I took off his mask and that I wasn&#39;t ready for. When I lifted up the mask I saw my dad, I froze and looked at him. But he didn&#39;t freeze when he looked at me, he punched me in the face then got up and clenched his side. I look at him and say.
	“I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD!”
	“Yes I thought I was before I had realized what had happened. There I was sitting in my sell before I heard they alarm. I started to panic then it hit. I woke up to see I was the only survivor. So I picked myself up and decided to get up and try to leave. On my way out I grabbed a mask and a few guns from the army and left. That is when I saw you and Todd heading towards the hospital and I was on a path to revenge. So I spent the rest of my time hunting you down to kill you. And know I will have the sweat satisfaction of revenge.”
He looks at me and and pulls out the gun the BOOM. I look down and all around but no gun shot wound. That is when I see my dads face go white and he looks at his shirt and we see blood. I see him fall and Todd behind him with his shotgun. 
	“TODD!” I yell as I run to him
	“I* thought you were dead”
	“Nope the shot barely nicked my leg”
We smile and I then I help him towards the rescue boat. Once we get in they tell us about the war and how we are safe. I sigh a sigh of relief then I think what you I am going to do know. 




&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 150%;&#39;&gt;\
    Chapter 5\
&lt;/div&gt;


It. Has been 5 years since I was at the island I am know an official adult and I live in Colorado. I still keep in touch with Todd and I am going to the Colorado school of mines to get a degree in mechanical engineering. That is all that has happened since the island, and I intend to keep it that way.

Scarlett S.
	[[Back-&gt;Q-Z]] \
&lt;/div&gt;


				  

	
“I don&#39;t know…” I say looking at the purple and pink poofy dress that covers my feet completely. 
	
“Walk.” Ally commands. She’s a bit bossy sometimes, and by that I mean all the time.
	
“Okay jeez!” I say. I walk forward and even barefoot I instantly trip. 
	
“Nevermind” she frowns, disappointment filling the room. I stare ahead at the beautiful red and black dress, that would hang just above my knees. I walk forward and grab it. I look at Ally and she rolls her eyes and nods. 




“Black or red heels?” I ask walking out of the dressing room.

“Try both.” she says. “But either way you would look like Harley Quin.” She smiles. I roll my eyes. 

“Can Harley Quin pull of silver  hair?” I say touching my long silver hair.


“You know what? Even if she could, You’d still be way better looking.” she says in such a serious voice it makes me laugh so hard. 

“Red heels?” I ask Ally.

“Most definitely” She answers.

I turn around and see my worst enemy, Plaza L. She&#39;s hated me since second grade when I came to Duel Heights K-12 School For The Gifted. Everyone thought I was Gifted for the horns on my head but really it was because I could rewire a cell phone in under 30 minutes. 

“Well if it isn&#39;t the famous Licky Stiff.” Plaza L. says with the most snooty voice I think I&#39;ve ever heard in my life. 

“Pizza! How&#39;s it going?!” I say with the most sarcasm in my voice. She rolls her eyes.

“I&#39;d never thought i would be nice to you but i kindly force you to come with me Lizzy Smith.” She says in a fake sweet voice. I hesitate but she grabs my arm and pulls me away. Ally begins to follow us but Plaza turns around and scowls at her, and she stops walking.

“Hey stop pulling me so hard I&#39;m wearing heels!” I say annoyed She pulls even harder and I sit down. 

“Hey! Get up!” she demands. 

“Rip this dress see what happens” I say. I tilt my head down so if she tries to come near she’d get poked in by the horns on my head - oh i forgot to tell you I have black horns on my head and a pet dragon. His name is dasherslowface, dasher for short. He is really slow but dasher is a really amazing name for him. Slowface sounded too mean. When I was younger  I had black wings, but when I was five, they were cut off by my dad in fantasy land. He wanted them for himself. 
	
Anyway, when I go to look up she grabs my feet and pulls me. I scream. 
	
“You deserve this you know.” she grins.
	
I look at where we are going and realize we are headed to the portal to fantasy land. 
	
“Wait you know where…” I pause looking at her. She nods. I gasp. 
	
“Wish you had your wings now licky?” she says and pushes me through the supposedly hidden from mortal eye. “Bye licky!” she says and pushes me through the portal.

&lt;div align=&#39;center&#39; style=&#39;font-size: 120%;&#39;&gt;\
Chapter 2 \
&lt;/div&gt;
I fall to the ground with a loud bang. 

“OW!” I say rubbing my head. I begin to walk. The portal spit me out in a different spot than usual. I see a unicorn and smile. 

“Nothing like a unicorn to start of my trip.” I say sarcastic. 

Now you see, unicorns are not as you would expect them to be in a mortal world. They, well they are not white with pink hair and sparkle magic. They are pink with heavy blue makeup they proplay slept in, and have dark brown hair. Their hair is ratty and is clumped everywhere. You&#39;d be lucky to find one with neat hair and not so heavy makeup.

“What is that supposed to mean?!” the unicorn says- oh yeah they can talk to. I roll my eyes and walk away. Randomly, out of nowhere, a griffin comes down and scoops at my feet barley missing. I squeal. And run. Run like my life depends on it which in my defense it does. A griffin is like a tiger in the mortal world, they will eat you. 

I stumble a lot with my heels on. I realize that it is chasing me in my birth moms (The evil queen) castle. I run away from the castle and nearer to my old house. It flies away when it realized that i&#39;m going in a different direction. I sit on my knees panting. 

I rip my heels of my shoes, and they become flats. Iytq	take the heels and tie them around a stick using the chocolate grass. I know ill never go hungry when everything is made of candy, but I might gain a thousand pounds. 

I realize I need to gather healthy food to survive. I spotted an orange tree near the castle, and expect that to be one of my mothers tricks - to lure me to her so she can do whatever she wants to do to me. 

I decided to head a different direction, towards the portal. I&#39;m positive I saw a forest of fruit and a garden of vegetables. 

When I get there I begin collecting oranges with my spear. I need water but to cure my thirst, I stab the oranges with my spear and drink the juice from it. It has a tang, but it&#39;s good when your thirsty. 

I drink the juice from 10 oranges before i collect more fruits and vegetables. I pull my gold handbag from my side. The people here are friendly here and give discounts, but there is no way they will take mortal money.  
I walk to the Fantasy Bank, to exchange my cash for unicrnies, which is what they call money here. 
“Hi!” I say. I smile at the very familiar face ahead of me. I&#39;m not looking forward to all the people crowding me, saying welcome back and stuff like that. He stares, amazed.
“You know, we all miss you.” He grins handing me the money. 
I blush and nod. He chuckles. 
“Have a wonderful day lizzy smith.” he says and smiles. I walk out, fast. Like I said I won&#39;t be here for long, so i don&#39;t want any attention. 
I hear screaming as soon as I walked out of the bank. It sounds close, near the portal. I decided to ignore it and purchase my water. I drink the whole bottle in one gulp. I buy another one so i don&#39;t go thirsty. 
I walk up to a stand near the beach. It&#39;s new so I decided to give it a chance. 
I look at the menu

Menue
Unicrn skin
Hamburgr
Chez bugr
Griffenz blod
Watr
Penut butr jely


“Ok. Nevermind” I say turning around to go to my favorite stand; The Pixie Place. They have amazing food. 
I order the usual, Peanut, potatoes, pork, pineapple, pickle, pepper, pepperoni, pear, pomegranate, pinto beans, poppy seeds pizza. Now it&#39;s just a  barbecue pizza, but it lists every ingredient they use for the cheese and the sauce and the crust.
As I finish my pizza, I hear my name being called. I look around. Nothing. I shove the remaining pizza into my mouth. I get up grabbing my spear and water bottle and begin walking near the voices. I stop. I walk to the clothing department. Their clothes are the best. I purchase a black jumpsuit. The material feels nice against my skin. 
I also by a tote bag to keep food and drinks in - and my dress. I don&#39;t want to waste my unicornies, but i need tennis shoes. So I walk back in a by the cheapest pair they have. 


I collect fruits on my way to the voices I hear. They get closer and closer. I yell that I&#39;m here every 4 times they call my name. I can tell its a group of girls and a boy. I stop collecting fruits once my bag is totally full. I can still close the magnetic clasp but its too full to zip the zipper.  
I feel like ive been searching for hours when i see people through the trees. And it not a unicorn either. I run to the people, my legs hurt so bad but I won&#39;t give up. Finally i see my best friends and my boyfriend. 
“Oh my god!” I say excited. “How did you get here!” I ask. 
“Ally saw you leave. There was a glowing thing and She called everyone to come quick. We wanted to help you.” Evie says. 
Ally smiles. I hug kevin, whom I haven&#39;t seen for a few weeks. I hug all 5 of them. 
“Evie, Because you have a backpack, I need you to collect fruits and vegetables.” I say. 
“Um okay…” She says annoyed. 
“We can&#39;t spend all my unicornies on food.” I say and then a griffin comes and scoops up kevin. I scream. 
“Come on. I know where he is going! I say panicked.
I run to the castle. My mom is waiting on the steps. 
“I knew you’d come.”  She says she throws kevin at me. “Make it back. If you can, &#96;&#96;she laughs. 
	We start heading back. A unicorn lunges at me. I scream and we run away. Four more lung at us until we are safely through the portal. 
	“Thank god we got it ouat safley.” I say. And we head home. Kevin, Ally, Evie, Jennifer, Callie, and me. Safe and sound

It was my birthday, I was at a park playing with my friends. My friends and I were playing tag. David and Chris were tagging each other but nobody could get me. All of a sudden random growling behind the bushes surprised us. Then I saw it, a komodo dragon! Everyone except me was scared of the komodo dragon. I wasn’t scared because I once had a komodo dragon, but sadly I had to give it away because he was very messy.

I went up to the dragon and I touched it’s nose.  Then it stopped growling and went back into the bush. But when my friends and I went home, it followed me home. Before I unlocked the door he got closer and closer. So I let him in and I said to him, “You are my best birthday present ever!” The komodo dragon and I became friends and I named it Odell Backham Jr. Odell Beckham Jr. is my best friend now and I like going on walks with him. He gets lots of attention on our walks because he walks so funny. He uses his two front feet and tail. One day my dad and mom died, so the komodo dragon took care of me.
 
One day we went on a hike. The weather was snowy, cold, and very foggy. I heard a roar in the woods so I got scared.  The was a bear chasing me. My friend the dragon protected me by biting the bear in the neck. Then the bear ran away. Another time the other dragons tried to attack me, but he told them not to because he is my friend. Odell Beckham Jr. missed his family so he decided to go back to his kind. I felt very lonely and didn’t know what to do. I’m going to miss him but at least he is happy.

Because they&#39;re  in the forest.


“Hey” said Max, “look, a berry bush, I&#39;m going to get some food.”
“Wait” said Dustin, “That may be poisonous, let me use my hunting skills to check it”. 
“Thanks” said Max. 
“Hey Max” said her brother Lucas “I can&#39;t believe you fell for that!”
 “Fell for what?” said Max 
“That!” said Lucas. Then Max looked in the direction Lucas was pointing, there was Dustin eating all the berries.  He had blueberries and strawberries all over his hands and then,
 “Hey Dustin” said Max, “your dead meat!” 
“More like dead berries said her brother Mikey”. 
“Hey, Dustin” said his sister April, “ run!”. Dustin started to run while Max started to chase him. Lucas, April ,and Mikey watched and laughed, then Lucas and Max’s sister, Lillie came and said,
“Hey guys, uh why is Max chasing Dustin again?”
 “Oh he tricked Max and ate her food” said Mikey “again” said April. “Yup said Lucas hey you two stop! We got to get moving, let&#39;s go back to our hideout! “Ok said Dustin and ran over here let’s go”. So they got moving. When they got back to their hideout it had become night time so they went to sleep. 
	When morning came Mikey got up to go get some breakfast he came back with berries and fresh meat and started cooking. After he was finished he woke the others up and they ate their breakfast but for Max since she was allergic to meat he made her a berry breakfast. “ Do you guys like the food I made” said Mikey yup said April it&#39;s amazing we love it. “ What about you Max” said Mikey, Max said “It’s amazing thanks I love berries but we gotta start going we need to look for our parents and we need to take everything with us”.

	“So what do we do know they got Apri?” Asked Lillie	 well said Mikey uh lets just have fun not think about get her out of our minds” 	&#39;&#39;Mikey’s right said Lucas forget about my sister for now come on lets play!”	  “I don’t want to see more” said april  meanwhile 			wait said Dustin we are going to look for her after right?”

“Aright say hello to our new team member! But were going to need you to look a little more game over you need a serious  makeover” said Mya. As April got a makeover that went into night to good guys were having fun then went to bed and when tomorrow came a new adventure begins.	” Are your sure that this makeover is right said April I look so bad but yet cool”       “that’s the point said Mya plus now you&#39;re really apart of game over” 	“no net yet said Xever we got put her to “The test” then train her to see if she really wants to stay”  	“I almost forgot said Mya hey Reed it’s time for The test” “

“uh it’s apart of “The test” duh said Xever were here take off the blindfold this is where “The test” is we all had to take although we already trusted each other just had to make sure so first you must answer hard questions second you must train to see if we can trust you not to fight us or even fight for that matter and, well save the best for last”. 			

“What’s the best?” Asked April	 “we are saving it for the last duh said Reed besides it a surprise” 	“alright it’s the surprise we need to test your loyalty then you have to fight us said Mya we set you up to a lie detector we’ll know when your lying let the&#39;&#39;Test” begin&#39;&#39;.

&lt;/div&gt; 	

Hi, my name is Mars, and I’m 14 years old. I have short chestnut hair, and green eyes, my dog Cricket, is an old 15 year old Beagle. My parents, Jackie, and Andy, abandoned me when I was only 6 years old and left me with my dog, Cricket. I learned how to take care of Cricket and I from then on, I learned how to cook, clean, and many other skills. I had money that my parents had left me. At least 1,000 dollars. My parents had left me the money to take care of myself, I suppose. And now, I’ve had enough of my quiet, boring, life, and I’m gonna make my own life outside. I was sitting on my bed, thinking of where I could sleep if I left TONIGHT.

 I thought the train station might work. “But what if they won’t allow me in?” I thought out loud.. I had to think of something else. I was thinking I could search the dark alley, and look in the dumpster for some used furniture that nobody wanted anymore. “Yeah, that’s a good idea,&#39;&#39;
 I thought, Cricket already has his bed, so I don’t need to worry about him. The rest of the day passed by incredibly quick. It was almost 8:30PM and I needed to start packing. I’m gonna miss this old house. I went up the squeaky stairs to my bedroom, and started to pack everything I needed, such as clothes, food, water, blankets, and money. I also packed a small bag for Cricket. He had, some toys, food, water, his favorite blanket, and a bone. I just sat on my bed with Cricket, thinking if this was a good idea. 

I was thinking for a couple minutes and decided that I would go. I grabbed my bag and Crickets bag, as well as his leash. We walked out the front door, and I began to say my goodbyes to my old house. “Goodbye, quiet home.” I then said; “Shall we?” I asked to Cricket. Alright, off we go, I suppose. We began to walk for about 15 minutes when I started missing home. Before I could turn around there was some insane looking officer staring at me. 
“Do you have a problem?” I shouted
“You look too young to be out here yourself”. The officer exclaimed.
“I’m 14, I’ll be perfectly fine”. I then said.
Just then, the officer started chasing Cricket and I. He was chasing us down the sidewalk. 
“STOP!” I shouted. He didn’t respond. I turned around and I didn’t see the officer.
“What the heck?” I said in concern. I turn my head, then I black out.

It had seemed forever since I had woken up, but it was most likely only 10 minutes. Where the heck was I? It seemed I was in an all white room with a white chair and a white desk, white walls, too. I don’t understand, and I don’t see Cricket anywhere. There’s a small window by the wall on the right. I went up to the window and started yelling and banging for help. The officer appeared through the window.

“Where am I, and where is my dog!” I screamed. 
“You’re safe now, and your dog is in the room next to you.” He said calmly.
“I want my dog. NOW.” I said fearlessly.
“Fine, don’t go anywhere, now.” He teased me. I hated the officer.
About 1 minute later, he was holding Cricket standing near my window.
“Give him to me, creep!” I yelled.
He opened the window and gave Cricket to me. Cricket immediately started wagging his tail.
“Hi, sweetie!” I said loudly. Cricket started licking my face as I held him.
“When will you let me out?!” I screamed.
“When you’re old enough to.” Said the officer.
“This is ridiculous, I’m 14.” I said sadly.
“I don’t care, you’ll have to stay here for as long as I say”. He shouted.
The officer then walked away and shut the window. What the heck am I supposed to do now? There was a tiny lock on the window. And the window was big enough for Cricket and I to fit through. But how would I open the lock? Wait, I have a bobby pin in my hair, I’ve seen this on  television. I grabbed the bobby pin and proceeded to unlock the lock. I then inserted the pin in the lock and kept budging it till I heard a minor click. “Yes”, I thought. I hesitantly opened the slide and put Cricket through first. Then I placed his leash down carefully. Now, was the hard part. Getting myself through. I began to stick my head out and slowly made my way down. All of a sudden, my foot accidentally bumped the metal surrounding on sides of the window, and I froze my body quickly.

 I then heard a distant, “HEY!”. I started to freak out and I squirmed out of the window as quickly as possible. I quickly grabbed Cricket, my bag, and RAN. I heard footsteps behind me faintly. I was walking through never ending hallways. It felt like a maze. The footsteps started getting louder, and I began to run even faster. I think Cricket was confused. I kept hearing mumbling behind me. I finally found a door that looked like it lead outside. I pushed the heavy door open, and I was outside. But I don’t know where. There were just trees, and grass, that’s it. I kept running, though. I kept running till I found a safe place. It was a playground that seemed quite far from where I started. I was sure I lost the officer.

 	I think Cricket was hungry. I grabbed his small, orange bag and took out the dog food. I grabbed the small bowl, too. I poured some dog food into his bowl and he devoured it. Poor Cricket. I also poured some water into the same bowl, and he turned out to be thirsty, too. I put everything back into the bag, and I began walking to my destination. I knew where I was at least. I finally arrived at the dark alley and went to the dumpster. I found a small, but decent couch behind the dump. I grabbed the couch by its arm, and pulled it towards myself. I pulled it all the way out the alley, and began to search for a place to sleep, as it was getting super dark.

 	I found a small secluded area will a cement floor and a slanted roof. I don’t know what it was, but it would have to work. After about 15 minutes of pulling the stupid couch, I had made it. I set up the couch in the middle of the cement floor. I put Crickets bed next to the couch, and I gave him a treat, and his favorite blanket.I looked at my watch, it was about 1:00AM. I put a blanket over myself, and we both went to sleep.

It was the next morning, and I had to start moving. I woke Cricket up from his slumber as he slouched out of his small brown bed. It was about 7:00AM. I got my bags and began to leave with Cricket. I think I should stop at the park, which is right next to the forest. I wanted to eat breakfast somewhere peaceful. I walked to the park, and sat down in the fuzzy grass. Cricket was extremely tired, as well as me. I pulled out a frozen waffle from my backpack, and bit into it. It was really frosty, and cold. Not gonna lie, it was disgusting. I expected it to be soggy, but it was still frozen, it’s freezing outside.

 	I poured Cricket some dog food, and of course, he devoured it. We were done eating, and it was time to leave. I got up, grabbed Cricket’s leash, and we began to walk, almost to the end of the park, I saw a little girl without her parents, walking her Husky. She probably lived near one of these houses. The girl looked to be about eight or seven years old. I was approaching the Husky, and then the dog started barking in anger. I don’t know why that dog got a bad vibe from Cricket. I pulled Cricket over to me, but just then, the Husky had ran over to Cricket and bit Cricket’s back.

 	The little girl couldn’t hold onto the dog any longer. Cricket let out a huge screech. I pushed the Husky off of Cricket immediately, but Cricket was already injured, and I didn’t have a chance of saving him. I told the little girl to, “GET OUT OF HERE”, as I was balling my eyes out. The little girl started running away with her dog and started to sob, but I didn’t care. I was so angry. I picked up Cricket as he was whining like crazy. I went deep into the forest so nobody knew what I was doing. Cricket was old. Injured.

 As soon as I knew I was deep enough into the forest, I laid out my large blanket, and sat down, as well as putting Cricket into my lap. I waited, and waited. I then gave Cricket his favorite blanket and a bone. He wouldn’t even touch the bone. I’m sure his spine was cracked. I started stroking his soft fur for a while, and then.. Cricket took his last breath. I didn’t cry. I started to say how much I had loved Cricket for so many reasons, and how I would never forget him, he was my best friend, my best companion, my whole world. I’m sorry, Cricket. I layed Cricket down on my blanket, and put his favorite blanket over him, I gave him a kiss on the head as I shed a few tears. Goodbye, Cricket.

 I decided I would leave. I looked at Cricket one last time and started moving forward. I came out of the forest, and started to walk down the forest. It was so weird to think that 1 second, Cricket was walking with me, and the next.. He wasn’t. But I had to stop thinking about him. I continued walking with my head down.

I’ve been walking for a long time, and I was hungry. So I decided to look in my backpack for something to eat. “Wait, where’s all my food, and my money?”I thought. I couldn’t find anything, where did it go? Someone must have stolen it, I was sleeping, and my bag was wide open for everyone to see inside. Crap. Someone stole my food and money. 
“I’m going to die”, I thought. I decided to sit down, and beg for money. I was lost, I didn’t know where I was, I couldn’t go back home. I sat down, took off my hat, and made a sign that said, “Please help me, I need money,&#39;&#39; with a piece of paper, and a marker that I had found in the dump.

Hours past, nobody cared. I don’t know what to do, I’m helpless. I started ugly crying, because I was so stressed. “Stop crying”, I thought. And I did after a little while. I got up and started walking some more. After about 20 minutes of countless steps, I decided a small nature hike would boost my happiness. I took a sharp turn into the forest, and I found a small trail. Mrs“ Alright, this doesn’t seem too bad”. I began to walk hesitantly, and actually, I was enjoying it, the birds chirping, the sound of the grass swooping, and more peaceful sounds than you can imagine. It was insanely gorgeous as well, the greens, blues, and the browns. All of a sudden, I see a huge flock of birds fly in the opposite direction of where I was headed. “That’s odd”, I thought. Everything went silent. A second later, I heard loud, and obnoxious steps towards me, I froze. I saw a bear in the distance. Or at least I think it is. It seemed angry, it was showing its teeth as if I was invading its territory. Stupid me, started to run.The bear started chasing after me. “AHHHH!”, I yelled. The bear just got angrier and angrier. “What was I thinking?”, I said out loud. I was almost to the end of the forest, I could see light! I didn’t see the stump. I tripped and.. I blacked out. Again.

I woke up, and now, I saw no bear. I was just laying there, nothing even hurt, with birds chirping, once again. I got up quickly in fear. I ran out of the forest, now what?! “Nothing can ever go my way!”I shouted. I have no money, and no food, I feel weak. Something is off with me. I’m not healthy, I feel like I’m not existent. I feel like I’m drifting off. My mind might be screwed up, because I’ve blacked out so much. I need to rest. I then walked, without even knowing where I was, but that was the whole point, right?

2 hours later, I found myself in the forest, again. I could barely walk. “I think I’m hallucinating”, I thought. It was almost 12:00AM, and it was the definition of black there. It was icy cold, I couldn’t see. What was I supposed to do now? I was lost, for the third time. I grabbed my purple blanket out of my backpack, and laid it down on the cold dirt. I sat, and waited. Waited. I laid down, and waited. Waited. All of a sudden, I feel a strong stinging pain across my body. Is this really how death feels? It was dark, I couldn’t even see my surroundings. I knew it was time. I’m coming soon, Cricket. I slowly closed my eyes. “Goodbye Cricket”, “Goodbye mom, and dad”, “Goodbye world”. I mumbled. I feel as if I’m dying too young. There’s so many things I haven’t done yet. I wasn’t ready for what was about to happen. Please don’t take my life yet. But, it was time for me to leave this Earth. Maybe I’ll have a better life next time. 
I took my last breath, I was gone.

“Why did I do this?” said Jaslene. Jaslene was with a friend, Dash, a life expert on the moon or on Earth. She and Dash got chosen to go to the moon. So Dash read up on the moon, and Jaslene got a kit of tools and a first aid kit. Then when they got into space something went wrong with the engines and they crashed on the moon. When Dash got out from the rocket and said, “I will go look around and see if there is life here on the moon” and left. 

After two hours Dash return and with a bone. “Where did you get that,” asked Jaslene. She was going crazy. Then Dash said, “Calm down this bone looks like it is from 100 years ago. Also did you bring a tool kit in case this would happen. So they when in the rocket to get some sleep so they can start fixing the ship in the morning. When Jaslene woke up to fix the rocket but some parts of the rocket were gone. She went to ask Dash but he was gone.

Then one day Jaslene went to find Dash but he stop and look around and when he saw nothing he went on. She went back to the rocket and got a notebook out of Dash’s pack he brought. Then went after Dash and started writing down some notes then saw Dash was gone right as he looked down. When Jaslene looked around and didn’t know were he went. Then she felt the ground go from under her. “Oh no,” Said Jaslene as she fell.

She went down a sinkhole. On the way down she saw people scream and people running then she landed at the bottom and heard a loud roar. A shadow on the rock wall and she looked around for Dash and heard a yell. Then she got the notebook and said in the notebook “I have found a sinkhole but have heard roars and screams. But no Dash... also if he is here then how did he find this place?” Then when she stopped writing in the notebook she saw Dash.

“Dash are you okay and how did you find this place? Also where are we?” said Jaslene. Then right before her eyes a big monster came in tried to grab Dash but Dash jumped and said to Jaslene 
“ Go and find the monsters home and get the rocket ship part back and get home but if I am not there just go.” So Jaslene ran to find the monster’s home. When she got to the monster’s house she saw a couple baby monsters and she thought that the  monster is just trying to keep the babies safe. So she went after Dash to stop him for hurting the monster.

    Sydney,Lily,and Simi all had a sleepover the night before Halloween  at Simi’s house . Their friend Kile, Reed, and Zach had a sleepover at Reed’s house.

 The girls texted the boys to go to Applebees and the boys said “Yes”. The girls were there first and Simi looked over in the kitchen and there was a guy staring at them . The boys had finally come around around 20 minutes after the girls arrived. Simi told Reed there was a guy in the kitchen staring at us. Reed looked and he wasn&#39;t there. Lily looked outside and saw a guy outside behind the building. She thought for a minute about the guy and then just forgot about it. After they left Applebees the girls got in the car and started driving home . 
Right before they got home they saw someone following them “Omg someone is following us!” said Lily “Really?” said Sydney “There is!” said Simi. 
As the guy kept following them, Simi realized it was the man in the kitchen. Lily just realized it was the guy from behind the building . Then they made a sharp turn and turned into an empty driveway . They turned off the music and the lights so the guy won’t see or hear them. They were silent for several minutes. The guy took a picture of the license plate and the girls didn’t even  know. They all went back to Simi’s house and they went straight to bed. 
“Ahhhhh!” said Simi as she woke up from a scary dream. 
“Phew, it was just a dream” Simi said. She looked over and the guy was sitting on the window sealS
 “HELP!” Simi screamed. The girls woke up from a sudden shock and they saw Simi in the corner shaking. The two girls l0oked at Simi and they saw that Simi  had a broken arm. 
They rushed into the car and went straight to the hospital . Simi was just dying in pain as the car sped to the hospital. 
They made it to the hospital and rammed through  the doors and yelled “Help, help, my friend broke her arm”. Finally a doctor came and put Simi in an emergency surgery. Lily and Sydney were in the waiting room and saw the guy in the corner. They moved over to the next row of chairs. The guy was suspiciously reading the newspaper . 

Lily asked the doctor “When did that guy come in?” “Right after you girls came in.” the doctor said. Sydney asked the doctor “Why is he here?” “I don’t know.” said the doctor. “Can we see his papers he had to fill out?” said Lily “No I&#39;m sorry that is classified information,” said the docter &#39;&#39;“You need to give us those papers now!”&#39;&#39; said Sydney  “Fine, fine I&#39;ll give them to you, okay?” said the doctor. 
It said that he is 25 years old  and he is named Jason. He lived in Orange County, California for 8 years and then moved to Williston North Dakoda. He is a chef at Applebees. He has dark brown hair and dark green eyes. He is single and lives in an apartment. “Omg...” they both said. “Wow, that is crazy.” said Sydney. “Yeah, you could say that again.” said Lily. 
The doctor came in and said Simi wants us to go in her room. We went into her room and said “Simi are you alright?” she said, “Yeah, I&#39;m ok. my arm is broken.” “Oh we know.” said the two of them . Simi said the guy did it; The guy from Applebees. “What how?” asked Simi. How does he know where Simi lives?” asked Lily.
 “Wait we did see him drive passed us. Could he have taken a picture of our license plate and found the car infront of Simi’s house?” asked Sydney. Then Simi woke up and he had broken her arm . “Yes we summed it up. So he did brake Simi’s arm and he has been following us.  He probably hid behind the corner and when we drove by he followed us to the hospital.” said Lily. Sydney walked out the door  and the guy was still there. She ran to the doctor and yelled “That guy broke my friends arm, call the police now!” He called right away and the guy got arrested for stalking them.
Lily called Kile and he said they were on their way over so Lily just waited for them. They got here and Reed asked “ Where’s Simi?” We told him room 245 on the third floor “Ok.” said Reed and he went up to the room. Lily and Sydney had to fill out papers . Simi was resting and Kile and Zach were sitting in the waiting room. They decided to move to Africa for a year to forget about this tragedy that happened today. A week later they moved to Africa and eventually Reed and Simi got married and they all decided to live in Africa permanently and live a long and happy life!

 One day the Wilson family was planning to go on a  carrabian cruise. When planning the cruise, the daughter of the family, Emily,  asked if they could  go somewhere else, because she really  doesn&#39;t like water. But her brother, Mike, said that everything would be okay! 

         Emily was feeling a little better and told their mom to book the trip. A day later they took their flight to the state where the boarding dock was at and had boarded the cruise. While on the cruise they went to the pool, played games and spent time with each other. Then, on the second night around 7:38 pm it was announced that an iceberg hit the ship and everyone had to evacuate. 

       The Wilsons where scared  but they managed to grab their wallets and purses. 
Thankfully the cruise had enough lifeboats for everyone. So Emily, Mike and their mom and dad got on a lifeboat  and safely evacuated. There was a small island in the distance and they decided to travel there. When they figured out where to go Mike looked over to see Emily crying. 


      “We will be okay Emily, mom and dad know what there doing” Mike gently told Emily.

 When they arrived at the island Mike told everyone that they should make a fire, so mom and dad got wood and started the fire. Emily and Mike were talking about how they wanted to go home that night.  While at the fire they tried to discover ways and methods of how to build a shelter to protect them. 
 
        They had some good ideas, like taking wood or branches and putting  them against the trees. After they talked about what they&#39;re going to do. The Wilsons put their hands to work and got moving. They got the wood and started making a shelter for the night. After they made the shelter they began to go into the shelter so they can sleep. It was turning to night time and Emily looked nervous and scared. 
     
                      Mike had no clue of why Emily looked scared and nervous. He thought she was excited that they’re going home tomorrow. Mike was thinking about that all night  until he fell asleep on the cold, sandy ground. The next day they hoped on the raft and sailed across the sea for about an hour. Later they came across a small island called Cuba. They got a hotel to spend the night and the next day they booked a flight to come home. The Wilsons were thankful to go home.

“Ring, Ring,” my phone rang so I checked the phone. There was one message from a game company. It was about I aced a test! Now I have a job. I was so happy and I cried for 2 seconds. But at that time, I didn’t know what was going to happen to me. The first day working at the company was ok but after 7days, a guy called B-dude started to annoy me. And then, I realized the reason why he annoyed me. He used to bully me since kindergarten. I can’t believe he got this job because I  know that he is just a dumb guy who liked to bully me. 

Now it’s been 1 month since I got hired by this company. B-dude is now trying to kick me out of this company. But guess what? Making the game app is my only strength.  I am really good at it.   And this is the only game app company in the world. Just in case if I get a kick out of this company, I am not able to earn money from anywhere and I can’t pay for my rent, and I’ll end my life starving. I am not going to let that happen to me.

“Ring, rIng” my alarm rang. My day started. It has been 2 month worked for this company already. I met two nice co-workers and they were my friend since I was in kindergarten. I am lucky that I met my friends but not lucky because I met B-dude. The other day, I was talking with my two friends and I herd that B-dude is telling the company boss fake information to make him kick me out of this company. I was so mad at the time. So I decided to take revenge on him. Also my two friends agreed to help me taking revenge on him. My friends are going to tell the company boss only good information about me to boss so I don’t get fired. While my friends are helping me, I am going to capture bad things that B-dude does and make a video to show my boss that he is the one who should get fired. Also, I am going to get the boss’s trust so boss can trust me and fire B-dude.


 	Now I worked for this company for one year and also I am used to this alarm ringing. Because I did such a great job on effort, I finally got the boss&#39;s trust. Now I’m not just a co-worker, I got advanced! And now this is time to take revenge on B-dude. My two friends and I walk into the boss’s office and showed him how bad B-dude has been performing. He yelled at some co-workers even though he is a co-worker. He always said mean words to others. So my boss decided to fire B-dude from the company. My two friends and I were happy. We succeeded in our mission! 

But I felt sorry because I made him get fired. I decided to take B-dude out to lunch. During lunch, I suggested to B-dude to make boxing dojo and he succeeded. Because he used to do boxing a lot, now he has become the world’s most famous boxer. B-dude and I now are best friends and we won’t fight again. Never.

	Hi my name is James, I have blonde hair, blue eyes, and I wear ragged clothes. When I was born my parents didn’t want me so they sent me off to an orphanage in a medium sized city. So I lived for about 12 years in that awful orphanage. Then finally on my 13th birthday I got adopted by a super sweet family. They took me home into their house in the forest, but it was a lot nicer than I expected. At their house they had 2 dogs and no other pets. They were a super nice family but I had no siblings. A few weeks after they adopted me the dad died from a heart attack and then the mom died of heartbreak. Then I ran away into the forest.
	I brought all of my belongings with me just in case I needed them. Then I ran out of breath and all that I remember was waking up on the ground somewhere in the forest. After that I decided that this would be a good place to live. So I found a stick and a sharp rock and started to carve a knife. When I finished that I went out to go hunt and came back with 3 bunnies. So I started a fire and then I roasted the bunnies.
	Then I started to build a house, so I went out collecting sticks, rocks, dirt, and grass. When I finished collecting everything that I would need for the base I started building. When I finished building the base a few hours later a secret portal showed up and then sucked a demon that I had no clue was there out from inside of me. I was really scared. It made me think that that is the reason that my parents put me up for adoption.	
I tried to live the way that I was but having the demon come out of me really affected me badly. So I continued building my house and I got pretty far. The next day I went into my house and the portal reappeared and I think that something came out of it while I was asleep and that freaked me out. So that day I was really paranoid because I thought that the demon was going to attack me. So I finished building my house that day. 
	A few days later at like midnight  I felt something breathing on me and so I opened my eyes and the demon was right by me and so I ran screaming. Then I stopped running after like 5 minutes and when I looked behind me there was nothing there and when I turned my head forward he was there standing right in front of me and everywhere that I looked like he was right there. So I tried to run to the nearest place and after running for a while, I saw a city. So I ran into the city and when I looked behind me he wasn’t anywhere in sight.
	So I stole some food from a market and then ran back into the forest. Nobody was near me so I thought that I was safe.  I stopped to rest for a minute and ate some of the food that I got. Then I ran back to my house and got prepared, just incase I ever saw the demon again. 
 I started thinking that maybe he has a weakness like light, since he always attacks in the dark. So I decided my first attempt would be to use light. A few minutes later he appeared again. So I ran to the brightest spot in the forest and then when he got there the sun beamed  onto the back of his neck and then he turned into ash. I felt really happy that he was gone. 
	I began to search for a city to live in, because I didn’t want to live in my house anymore. After a few days,  I finally found one and then I wandered around it for a little. When a policeman saw me he walked up to me and he asked “Where are you parents?”
  I said that they are dead. So he took me in and he brought me to his house and then he let me sleep in the guest room. He and I got along really well, and he ended up adopting me.Then I lived happily ever after in my new house with the police officer.
